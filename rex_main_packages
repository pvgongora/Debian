Description: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
 class, which is part of the libwww-perl package.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation.

 Adding users with "adduser" is usually better than adding them
 by hand, since the new user's UID and GID are automatically
 selected, a home directory is created, skeletal user configuration
 files are copied to the new directory, and an initial password and
 finger information are set. The whole process can be customized by
 running a user defined script on adding a user.

 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed
 archives that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.

Description: A window manager with the NEXTSTEP look and feel.
 AfterStep is a window manager based on FVWM which attempts to emulate
 the NEXTSTEP look and feel, while retaining the configurability of its
 predecessor.  It is a continuation of the BowMan window manager project,
 but the name was changed to reflect the desire that it do more than
 simply emulate and be a valuable window manager in its own right.
 .
 The major changes from FVWM are:
   * NEXTSTEP-like title bar, title buttons, borders and corners. 
   * AfterStep's Wharf is a much worked-out version of GoodStuff. 
     To avoid copyright complications it is not called a "dock." 
   * NEXTSTEP style menu. However, the menus are not controlled by
     applications; they are more of pop-up service lists on the root
     window. 
   * NEXTSTEP style icons. These styles are hard-coded in the
     program, which is good for the consistent look of the NEXTSTEP
     interface.

Description: Highly versatile, high-performance extensible HTTP server
 The most popular server in the world, Apache features a modular
 design and supports dynamic loading of extension modules at runtime.
 Some of its strong points are its range of possible customization,
 dynamic adjustment of the number of server processes, and a whole
 range of available modules including many authentication mechanisms,
 server-parsed HTML, server-side includes, access control, CERN httpd
 metafiles emulation, proxy caching, etc. Apache also supports multiple
 virtual homing.
 .
 This release of the Apache server can replace any Apache server already
 installed with any standard module and guesses which modules should
 be loaded by looking at the site configuration files.  Any site-specific
 modules that were previously linked into Apache can then be dynamically
 loaded at startup.
 .
 The server also comes with some example and utility CGI scripts which
 may require some local customization.

Description: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM) on laptops
 On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support
 provides access to battery status information and may help you to
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM
 implementation. APM support has been in the kernel since 1.3.46.
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon that provides logging of the
 battery status, apm(1), a client that prints /proc/apm, xapm(1x), an
 X11 utility that displays a little graph, (and tailf(1) which follows
 the growth of a log file).
 .
 It requires an 1.3.x kernel and should work with both the old
 (pre-1.3.58) and the new (1.3.58) /proc/apm format. No further
 changes in the /proc/apm format are anticipated.
 .
 Starting with version 2.4 of apmd, --suspend and --standby are supported
 on kernels 1.3.98 or higher.

 switch diskettes using a diskette database through an intuitive
 interface.  Furthermore, it is possible to trim the speed of the
 emulator and it runs in full speed (approximately) twice as fast as an
 standard Apple II+ on a 486DX-50.  It uses the svgalib's key scancodes
 and implements the undocumented 6502 instructions (required by at
 least two games: Bug Attack and MS Pacman).
 .

Description: A Bourne-shell work-alike, smaller than "bash"
 Don't install this program, you already have "bash", which is a better
 shell than "ash".
 .
 The primary virtue of "ash" is that it's small, and we take advantage of
 that by making it the shell on the installation root floppy, where space
 is at a premium. "Bash", however, has some nice features absent from
 "ash", and "bash" is a required part of the system, so there isn't much
 reason to use "ash".

Description: Binary Editor And Viewer (beav)
 beav is an editor for binary files containing arbitrary
 data.  Text file editors, on the other hand, expect the
 files they edit to contain textual data, and/or to be
 formatted in a certain way (e.g., lines of printable
 characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY.  You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode.  You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes.  Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats.  While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering.   Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file.  The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format.  Files that are bigger than
 memory can be handled.

 addresses are on which side of the Bridge and forwarding only packets
 that are necessary. Linux will work like an Ethernet Switch!

 You should have at least Linux 2.0.22 installed with Bridging enabled

Description: Graham Stoney's mechanized man page generator
 C2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments from C
 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
 .
 features:
  + generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or
    HTML format
  + handles comments as part of the language grammar
  + automagically documents enum parameter & return
    values
  + handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
  - doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)

 the files before reading from standard input.  All normal
 output is to standard output; all error output is to
 standard error.

 A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack.
 Entering a number pushes it on the stack.  Arithmetic
 operations pop arguments off the stack and push the
 results.

 provide a single front end for all tests.
 .
 DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which allows you to write
 tests that are portable to any host or target where a program must
 be tested.  All tests have the same output format.
 .
 DejaGnu is written in `expect', which in turn uses "Tcl"--Tool
 command language.

Description: Linux "Debian Distribution" Packages Maintainer
 The purpose of this program is to make it easy to keep your local
 installation of Linux consistent with the Debian distribution
 available on many FTP sites, NFS mounts, or CD-ROM.  It does this by
 comparing the list of installed packages with those available by FTP
 or at a specified directory.  A list of packages, categorized to make
 selection easier, is then presented to the user to choose what to
 install.  All selected packages are then fetched if necessary (using
 FTP), verified for correctness, and then installed.
 .
 Dftp can also be run on a non-Debian machine in the case where the
 Debian machine does not have FTP access.  For this, stand-alone
 versions of dftp, in both "csh" and "perl" source, are available under
 /debian/project/misc.

Description: DHCP automatic IP address assignment
 DHCP is a protocol like BOOTP (actually dhcpd includes much of
 the functionality of BOOTPD!). It assigns IP addresses to clients
 based on lease times. DHCP is used extensively by Microsoft and more
 recently also by Apple. It is probably essential in any multi-platform
 environemnt.
 .
 The current DHCP implementations has limits because it can only
 assign IP addresses based on ONE Ethernet interface. Some changes
 to the kernel need to be made to enable multiple Ethernet Interface
 functionality which I expect will be include in some future 2.1.X Kernel.

MD5sum: e95090444ef1406915cdc2151d552a18
Description: dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP.
 Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone
 lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off.
 diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are
 Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link
 down when it is idle.
 .
 diald operates by starting a SLIP link on a pseudo tty and setting up
 a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the
 proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real
 communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from
 the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it
 needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly
 diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling
 these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup
 files.
 .
 For diald to work the kernel *must* have SLIP devices, either compiled in
 or as a module, even if only PPP connections are made. In the latter case
 you should also have pppd, of course.
 .
 Diald needs a program like "chat" or "expect" to actually dial.
 Sorry, "dip" cannot be used.

MD5sum: c8f9aa9e794fdabebce5e8418f4fd684
Description: File comparison utilities
 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 the end-user receiving your source code will simply have to read
 your README file, run the Configure script (which is self-documented),
 and then run make.
 .
 The second component is the Makefile.SH generator, which is a generic
 configured Makefile, reusing some of the information figured out
 by Configure, and a generic Jmakefile description.
 .
 The third component is the RCS aware package generator, which is
 used when it's time to build up the shell archives used to distribute
 your program.
 .
 The fourth and latest component is the patch generator, used to
 make updates of your sources, which can later be applied on the original

 The editor 'ee' (easy editor) is intended to be a simple, easy to use 
 terminal-based screen oriented editor that requires no instruction to 
 use.  Its primary use would be for people who are new to computers, or who 
 use computers only for things like e-mail.
 .

 make it possible for users to carry out tasks without the need to 
 remember commands.  An information window at the top of the screen shows 
 the user the operations available with control-keys.

Description: Programs to send and receive fax messages.
 efax is a small ANSI C/POSIX program that provides the data transport
 function for fax applications using any Class 1 or Class 2 fax modem.
 Another program, efix, converts between fax, text, bit-map and gray-scale
 formats. fax, a shell script, provides a simple user interface to the efax
 and efix programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript files as faxes
 and receive, print or preview received faxes. You need ghostscript to fax
 Postscript. To preview faxes you need a PGM file viewer as xloadimage.
 .
 Note that you probably have to adapt /etc/efax.rc to your needs.

Description: Development environment for 8086 Software development
 ELKS-86 = Embedded Linux Kernel Enviroment for 8086. The project
 attempts to provide a running Linux system for 8086 CPUs.
 .
 It contains a working assember, linker and C-compiler for 8086 cpus
 which is important for the development of boot loaders or BIOS related
 8086 code. C-Library and example code (tiny-utils) are also provided.
 .
 ELKS-86 can run 8086 code under i386 Linux by implementing a new executable
 binary format. The execution of 8086 code can be used for testing
 or to use the advantage of the compactness/speed of 8086 binaries.
 .
 ELKS-86 contains an upgraded version of as86 which is also a part of the
 binutils86 package (essential for compilation of the integrated kernel loader)
 .
 ELKS-86 can also be build on an MS-DOS system. This package will install the
 complete source code for ELKS-86 in addition to the binaries.

 Elm is a mail user agent (MUA) for Debian.
 .
 An MUA is the visible part of the mail system - It interacts with
 the user to display, store, create and send mail.
 .
 Other MUAs may may be used on the same system as elm without
 causing problems.
 .
 In order to make use of elm you must have a single mail transport
 agent such as smail or sendmail installed.  If you wish to send
 messages other than just to other users of your system you must
 also have appropriate networking support in the form of IP or uucp.
 .
 This version of Elm also has patches to allow it to work more
 comfortably with PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a program to keep
 prying eyes where they don't belong.

 also provides color syntax highlighting, with syntax modes for c, c++,
 java, awk, makefiles, perl, postscript, pascal, sh, tcl, vrml, html,
 diffs, man pages, and fortran.  If all this isn't enough for you, it is
 easy to add new syntax modes (additions are welcome!).

 .
 Each C source file is scanned for #define statements and global
 function definitions. The name of the macro or function becomes the
 name of a tag. For each tag, a line is added to the "tags" file
 which contains:
 	- the name of the tag
 	- a tab character
 	- the name of the file containing the tag
 	- a tab character
 	- a way to find the particular line within the file.

Description: An alternative to anonymous FTP
 In the words of the developers, FSP is what anonymous FTP should have
 been. Basically, FSP is more robust (an intermittent link doesn't phase
 it one bit) and kinder to slow links (the data transfer rate is
 significantly lower) than FTP; this enables a given server to handle
 requests from many more clients than a corresponding FTP server.
 Furthermore, the FSP clients are all run from the command line, storing
 certain information - such as the current directory - in the environment.
 As a consequence, whilst you are downloading a file, you can also be
 browsing other directories of interest.
 .
 From the clients' point of view, FSP allows the access restrictions to be
 lifted, because of the slower transfer rate. (How many times have you had
 "User anonymous access denied" flash at you?) From the servers' point of
 view, much less strain is placed on the network, and because the server
 never forks, the maximum increase in load is one.
 .
 If you want to learn more about FSP, the FSP FAQ is included in
 /usr/doc/fsp; it can also be accessed from the Web address
 http://itu.rdg.ac.uk/misc/fsp/faq/faq.htm
 .
 Two popular FSP sites are ftp.wustl.edu, port 21, and
 fsp.idsoftware.com, also on port 21. Both of these are identical to their
 corresponding FTP sites.

Description: A semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs.
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

 The GNU family of grep utillities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 It uses the gs PostScript interpreter and is based on the
 classic X front-end for gs, ghostview. It is more comfortable
 and more powerful than ghostview.
 .
 The new gs version (>= 4.0) can view PDF files.
 It is mostly compliant with Adobe's PDF format, so it has less
 problems than xpdf. There is no support for encrypted pdf files.
 It provides much better output than xpdf and even AcroRead (Adobe's
 PDF Reader) but is far slower.

Description: The Inter-Language Unification system 
 From the documentation:
 .
 The Inter-Language Unification system (ILU) is a multi-language object
 interface system. The object interfaces provided by ILU hide
 implementation distinctions between different languages, between
 different address spaces, and between operating system types. ILU can
 be used to build multi-lingual object-oriented libraries ("class
 libraries") with well-specified language-independent interfaces. It
 can also be used to implement distributed systems. It can also be used
 to define and document interfaces between the modules of
 non-distributed programs. ILU interfaces are specified in ILU's
 Interface Specification Language.
 .

Description: News transport system `InterNetNews' by Rich Salz
 INN is Debian's preferred news transport system.
 .
 The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles
 and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides
 those articles on request to users.  It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites.  Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as `expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn.  The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again.  It also provides the posting interface for the user.

Description: J is a dialect of APL freely available on a wide variety of machines.
 . 
 It is the latest in a line of development known as "dictionary APL".
 The spelling scheme uses the ASCII alphabet.  The underlying
 concepts, such as arrays, verbs, adverbs, and rank, are extensions
 and generalizations of ideas in APL\360.  Anomalies have been
 removed.  The result is at once simpler and more powerful than
 previous dialects.
 . 
 Why "J"?  It is easy to type.

 and produces a postscript file on the standard output.  
 .
 Jgraph is ideal for plotting any mixture of scatter point graphs, line
 graphs, and/or bar graphs, and embedding the output into LaTeX, or
 any other text processing system which can read postscript.
 .
 The graph description language is simple enough to get nice looking
 graphs with a minimum of effort, yet powerful enough to give the user
 the flexibility to tailor the appearance of the graph to his or her
 individual preferences.  This includes plotting multiple graphs and
 laying them out separately on the page (or pages).

 JOE has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are
 reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C.  JOE is much more powerful than those
 editors, however.  JOE has all of the features a UNIX user should expect:
 full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations (JOE is
 fully useable at 2400 baud), simple installation, and all of the
 UNIX-integration features of VI. (from the file INFO as distributed with joe)

 You may configure the kernel to your setup by typing "make config"
 and following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and
 tk4X-dev and try "make menuconfig" for a jazzier, and easier to use
 interface. Also, on intel platforms, you may wish to get bin86 (if
 you wish to compile the kernel sources, that is.)

Description: Write structured documents with TeX
 LaTeX is a macro package for TeX that makes writing of complex
 documents much easier. It features a style of writing
 that separates content and form as much as possible by providing the
 user with a generic (\ie logical rather than visual) mark-up interface;
 this is combined with style sheets which specify the formatting.
 .
 Users new to TeX should start with LaTeX. It has builtin support for
 automatic generation of table of contents, cross-referencing, index,
 etc. Tables and simple pictures are much easier to create, the font
 handling is much improved.

 uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety
 of terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.

Description: an ELF object file access library
 The elf library provides routines to access, and manipulate, Elf object
 files. It is still not complete, but is required for a number of programs,
 such as Eli (a state of the art compiler generation system), and Elk (the
 Extension Language Kit - an implementation of the Scheme programming
 language.)
 .
 This shared library may be needed by pre-packaged programs. To compile
 programs with this library, you will need to install the libelf-dev
 package as well.

Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX.
 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing
 commands to control the formatting - and produces a PostScript file
 (though it can also produce formatted plain text output).
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and
 it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout than in
 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

 adapted from Unix (which also happens to be a trademark) shells.

 lsh is especially useful for users who have had some DOS experience and
 are now supposed to do something under UNIX. This shell will ease the

Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.
 .
 GNU `m4' was originally written by Ren'e Seindal, with subsequent
 changes by Franc,ois Pinard and other volunteers on the Internet.  All
 names and email addresses can be found in the file `THANKS' from the
 GNU `m4' distribution.
 .
 This is release 1.4.  It is now to be considered stable, future
 releases are only meant to fix bugs, increase speed, or improve
 documentation.  However...
 .
 An experimental feature, which would improve `m4' usefulness, allows
 for changing the syntax for what is a "word" in `m4'.  You should use:
 ./configure --enable-changeword
 .
 if you want this feature compiled in.  The current implementation slows
 down `m4' considerably and is hardly acceptable.  So, it might go away,
 do not count on it yet. Depends: libc5

Description: An automatic mail-processing tool
 Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has
 far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure
 (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing
 tool, this slices, it dices, it ...
 .
 Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward
 messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post
 the message to a newsgroup.
 .
 It is also possible to process messages containing some commands. 
 .
 You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically
 answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the
 Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to
 be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
 substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into
 your vacation message, for a more personalized reply. 
 .
 You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the
 lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing. 
 .
 The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called
 via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That
 means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You
 also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts.
 .
 It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by
 implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded
 when used.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: Metafont - TeX's font engine
 Metafont creates bitmaps from a textual representation of a
 font (describing e.g. the outlines) and a description of the
 intended output device (describing e.g. the resolution).
 .
 Metafont is a powerful engine for font design, equipped with
 a macro processor similar to TeX's. The <Meta> means you could
 design a font using an arbitrary number of parameters and then
 create a series of fonts by just changing these parameters.
 It even allows interactive generation of fonts under the X11
 window system.
 .
 TeX's default fonts, the cm-series are specified using Metafont.
 .
 The normal user however will not use Metafont directly. It will
 be called automatically whenever bitmaps of a Metafont-Font are
 needed.

 Mgetty is also configurable to select programs other than login for
 special connections (eg: uucico, fido or other programs) depending
 on the login userid. It also supports caller-id if the modem and phone
 line supply it, and can deny connections based on originating
 telephone number.
 .
 'sendfax' is a standalone program which sends fax files.
 .
 'vgetty' is an extended version of mgetty that can answer the telephone
  like an answering machine and record a voice-mail message (if it finds
  one), or perform mgetty's fax or data call handling otherwise.
 .
 Version 0.99 adds functionality to detect incoming PPP connections.
 Does not log to the /var/log/auth.log anymore only to /var/log/mgetty/*.

 prints on the window status line of the screen the file name, current
 line number, and the percentage of the file so far displayed.
 .
 Unlike other paging programs, most is capable of displaying an
 arbitrary number of windows as long as each window occupies at least
 two screen lines. Each window may contain the same file or a different
 file. In addition, each window has its own mode.
 .
 In addition to displaying ordinary text files, most can also display
 binary files as well as files with arbitrary ascii characters.

Description: console mode dungeon exploration game
 Nethack is a single-user, fantasy role-playing computer game, a direct
 descendant of the games Hack and Rogue.  Nethack is a -very- complex game,
 compared to ones such as Moria, Rogue, or Angband.  There are several
 different character classes, a larger variety of items (from keys to
 artifacts), a leaner, meaner collection of monsters, and several quests that
 a player must finish before winning the game.  There are also many new
 dungeon features as well as interesting and quite amusing things that a
 player can do.
 .
 Much of the Dungeons of Doom within Nethack is borrowed from several fantasy
 genres, including Tolkien's Middle Earth, King Aurthor, and Dungeons and
 Dragons, as well as a few small references to Star Trek, Doctor Who, and the
 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Description: Set up server to allow nfsroot clients to boot.

 in any computer on your local network that has it's networkcard
 configured (running whatever OS), press "RESET", and hey presto,
 it's running LINUX!
 (and is configured to do just as much as your server, by default).
 .
 This package allows you to have most /etc files on the clients the
 same as the server, and some different. You'll need 30k disk space
 per potential client, and it's got a daemon that probes the network
 for hw adresses, and puts them in /etc/bootpd, and makes /tftpboot
 entries (excluding hosts in /etc/nfsroot/ignorehosts).

Description: Heavy-duty USENET news reader (curses-based client)
 nn stands for "No News is good news", and the nn newsreader is designed to let
 you minimize the amount of time you spend reading news (or, more
 realistically, to allow you to follow even more newsgroups :-).
 .
 nn allows you to quickly select articles of interest and skip the rest.  It
 also supports efficient article killing and selection of articles by author
 and subject.
 .
 This version of nn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network News
 Transfer Protocol), and can make use of your NNTP server's NOV database, if
 configured.  You must have a news server available - large sites usually
 provide a site-wide server.  (For those familiar with 'nn', this is a
 client-only version.)
 .
 (Having recently used both nn and trn, I think it's a tossup as to which is
 best, as trn seems to include many of nn's best features.  If you're a
 diehard nn user, "trn -x -XX" will start trn in a mode which somewhat
 resembles nn.)

 Pascal dialects: HP Pascal, Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC
 VAX Pascal, Oregon Software Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's
 Workshop Pascal, Sun/Berkeley Pascal. Modula-2 syntax is
 also supported. Output is a set of .c and .h files
 that comprise an equivalent program in any of several
 dialects of C. Output code may be kept machine and
 dialect-independent, or it may be targeted to a specific
 machine and compiler. Most reasonable Pascal programs are
 converted into fully functional C which will compile and
 run with no further modifications, although p2c sometimes
 chooses to generate readable code at the expense of absolute
 generality.

 The PARI system is a package which is capable of doing formal
 computations on recursive types at high speed; it is primarily aimed
 at number theorists, but can be used by people whose primary need is
 speed.
 .
 Although quite an amount of symbolic manipulation is possible in PARI,
 this system does very badly compared to much more sophisticated
 systems like Axiom, Macsyma, Magma, Maple, Mathematica or Reduce on
 such manipulations (e.g. multivariate polynomials, formal integration,
 etc...). On the other hand, the two main advantages of the system
 are its speed (which can be between 5 and 100 times better on many
 computations than the above mentioned systems), and the possibility of
 using directly data types which are familiar to mathematicians.

 Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
 includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card
 manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events,
 loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping''
 of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in

 Perl is optimized for scanning arbitrary text files and system
 administration. It has built-in extended regular expression matching
 and replacement, a dataflow mechanism to improve security with
 setuid scripts and is extendible via modules that can interface
 to C libraries.

Description: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) daemon.
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to
 transmit datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard
 way for the machines at either end of the link (the "peers")
 to negotiate various optional characteristics of the link.  Using
 PPP, a serial link can be used to transmit Internet Protocol (IP)
 datagrams, allowing TCP/IP connections between the peers.
 .
 This ppp implements the following special features (folded in from the
 former isp-ppp package):
 - Remote DNS Server Configuration for Microsoft Clients and compat.
 - Remote WINS Server Configuration for Microsoft Clients amd compat.
 - Bug Fix to accomodate incoming buggy Winsock PPPs (Trumpet Winsock) dialup
 - Logs to LOG_LOCAL2 so that the ppp logs are completely separate.
 .
 Together with mgetty-0.99 this package will allow extremely easy dialup
 configuration for Win95, NT or Win3.11 with IE 3.0. The user simply has
 to type your phone number, username and password and the webbrowser will
 work! No strange IP numbers to configure for the customer.

Description: The /proc file system utilities.
 This is an experimental release of the procps suite. A lot of features have
 been added since the 1.01(a) release:
 - support for both BSD and POSIX (SVR4) style command line options.
 - completely configurable display of information.
 - colour markup of processes exceeding limits or belonging to special users.
 Please take a look at /usr/doc/procps/NEWS, /usr/doc/procps/changelog.debian and
 the manpages for a concise list. This is how the next upstream release of
 procps may look (i.e. it will  look like this if there is not too much
 resistance).
 This is, for now, a debian-only package which should not appear outside of
 master.debian.org.
 .
 These are utilities to browse the /proc filesystem, which is not a real file
 system but a way for the kernel to provide information about the status of
 entries in its process table. (e.g. running, stopped or "zombie")
 Both command line and full screen utilities are provided. Ncurses is needed
 for the full screen utilities.

 rlpr  uses  tcp/ip  to send print jobs to lpd servers anywhere on a network.
 Unlike lpr, it does not require  that the  remote printers be explicitly
 known to the local system (traditionally through  /etc/printcap),  and  thus
 is considerably  more  flexible and requires less administration.
 .
 rlpr is essential for a campus setup with a ever changing population of
 printers since it allows to specify the host/printer from the regular
 shell prompt or from any program (like pine, lyx, dvixx ..)

Description: TCP/IP-SNMP Network Managment Extension for TCL.
 Scotty is a set of Tcl extensions to retrieve status information about 
 TCP/IP networks.  The extensions include commands to send icmp packets 
 a la ping, to lookup hostnames, to query the portmapper and mount 
 daemons.  Also included are generic tcp/udp extensions as well as 
 commands to query the domain name service for a, ptr, hinfo, mx and soa 
 records and commands to query ntp server. log messages can be written 
 by using the syslog command.  The perhaps most interesting extension is 
 an interface to the SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 protocols.

 Many different filtering methods are provided by Seesat5 so that only those
 satellites that might actually be viewed are presented in the report. This
 report includes bearing and elevation with respect to the observer's location
 as well as other information of interest to the observer.
 .
 Although an observer would find no use for it, the program can be made to
 report the location even when it is below the horizon. For radio satellites
 like the Oscar series knowing when it comes above the horizon is some of the
 interesting information this program can provide.

 The user must have access to an account on the sending and on the
 receiving site, too.
 .
 Sendfile for Unix, which is an implementation of the SAFT protocol
 (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) now offers you a true
 asynchronous file transfer service for the Internet.  Virtually any
 form of file can be sent, including encrypted ones.  The SAFT
 protocol will be submitted as an RFC in the near future.

Description: A system call tracer.
 strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the system calls made by a another proces/program.
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: Small newsfeed from an NNTP server with standard NNTP commands.
 This package contains software for copying news from an NNTP
 server to your local machine, and copying replies back up to
 an NNTP server.
 .
 The suck/rpost combination allows you to run your own INN/CNEWS site,
 controlling where you get your news, and where you post outgoing articles.
 Suck/rpost use only standard NNTP commands that are used by your favorite
 news reader (like tin, knews, trn) such as POST and ARTICLE.  If you
 can use tin or knews against a NNTP site, than you can use Suck/Rpost and
 have multiple site feeds.
 .
 NOTE: Suck will not work with obsolete NNTP servers that can't handle the
 xhdr command.

Description: Run higher resolution text modes.
 This program is designed to greatly improve the normal
 (EGA-based) textmodes on your Linux machine. It uses an Xconfig-like
 configuration file to set up better looking textmodes. (=higher resolution,
 larger font size, higher display refresh...) This is already a big boon on
 normal 14" displays, and it is an immense difference on larger and better
 (15" and up) screens.
 .
 It stems from the idea that it is a real waste of hardware to use EGA
 textmodes on an SVGA-card, which was designed to do much better than that.

 hosts.
 .
 The klogd daemon listens to kernel message sources and is responsible
 for prioritizing and processing operating system messages.  The klogd
 daemon can run as a client of syslogd or optionally as a standalone
 program.  Klogd can now be used to decode EIP addresses if it can
 determine a System.map file.

 SYSLINUX is a boot loader for the Linux operating system which operates

 loader; once the operating system is installed I recommend LILO as the
 boot loader, except for people whose root filesystem is a UMSDOS
 filesystem (where a DOS defragmenter could wreck havoc with LILO's
 carefully set up block tables) -- for them I recommend Loadlin (which
 loads Linux from the DOS command line).

 be used to print out the headers of packets on a network interface
 that matches a given expression. You can use this tool to track down
 network problems, to detect "ping attacks" or to monitor the network
 activities.

Description: Compatibility package for termcap-based programs.
 The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap
 files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based
 programs.
 .
 You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs
 since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this
 package if a program fails to run with the following error message
  "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'"
 or complains about a missing /etc/termcap file.
 .
 The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs
 therefore it doesn't provide all the necesary files for compilation. If you
 want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try
 ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses
 instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in
 the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries
 to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.
 .
 This package provides:
  libtermcap.so shared library, version 2.0.8
  termcap database, version 9.13.15

Description: TeX - The typesetting system
 TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth as a general typesetting
 engine that reads text together with interspersed commands,
 formats it and outputs a device independent description of
 the formatted pages. The input file is plain ascii, i.e. TeX
 does not feature a WYSIWYG approach to typesetting.
 .
 TeX includes a powerful macro processor allowing the creation
 of higher level packages hiding the TeX primitives from the
 user. The best known and most widely used of these is LaTeX.
 .
 Although designed with a strong emphasis on mathematics (and
 still the formulas generated by TeX are of a quality unsurpassed
 by widely used commercial packages) it's high quality linebreaking
 algorithm, the possibility to use multiple languages, fonts and
 encodings make it useful in many other fields as well.

Description: Tinyfugue MUD client for TinyMUDs and LPMUDs and MOOs
 TinyFugue (also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a line-based
 client designed for connecting to MUD servers (note: LP,
 DIKU, and other servers which use prompts require "/lp
 on"; see /help prompts). TinyFugue runs on UNIX-like systems,
 and on OS/2.
 .
 TinyFugue is larger than most MUD clients, but has many
 more features and is much more flexible. The goal is to
 provide the most functionality in a client that still
 maintains the user-friendliness of Tinytalk. Clients with
 extension languages such as Tcltt or VaporTalk can do a
 little more in certain areas, but are considerably harder
 to use and learn. TF provides most of these abilities in
 such a manner that learning to use any one function is
 relatively easy.

 from the floor of the cave and up to the surface. The blob is very heavy
 (compared to the ship) and this makes it tougher than it may seem. The fact
 that the connection between the blob and the ship is always of the same
 length also adds to the complexity. It is very easy to just spin around
 the mass center as soon as the ship and the blob are connected.

 The resources that `time' can report on fall into the general
 categories of time, memory, I/O, and IPC calls.

 The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by using a 
 printf-style format string to include various resource measurements.

 a news server available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server, 
 or the articles local on the host in /var/spool/news.
 .
 Note: If you read news from the local host, you will need to provide the
 executable /usr/bin/inews.  This can be found in the package

Description: Tk/tcl based X11 Desktop/File manager
 TkDesk is a graphical file manager for Unix (esp. Linux) and the X
 Window System. 
 .
 Compared with other file managers available, it offers the most
 complete set of file operations and services, plus gives the user the
 ability to configure most every aspect of TkDesk in a powerful way.
 .
 TkDesk has been influenced by various other systems and file managers,
 such as NeXT, for laying out the file browser windows, Apple Finder,
 for the idea of file annotations and, shock horror, Windows 95, for
 some other (of course minor and unimportant ;-) inspirations.

Description: An X windows interface to mail.
 This is an X windows interface to mail built using Tcl/Tk.
 Reading, sending, and managing mail messages can almost all be done
 using only the mouse (except for the body of the message, of course).
 TkMail writes its folders in the format of the standard unix 'Mail'
 command. It also uses 'sendmail' commands to do the mail delivery
 work.
 .
  Major Features:
  - listbox interface to messages for easy click and read
  - multiple viewers can be opened on different or the same folder
  - dynamic (at startup) menus for quick access to mail folders
    for reading, copying, and moving messages
  - button bar for quick composing, replying to, and forwarding of
    mail messages
  - built in 'biff' icon for notification of new mail on
    multiple folders
  - easy inclusion of files into message compositions with
    automatic uuencoding and compression, if desired
  - access alternate editor for compositions to send
  - reads aliases from either standard .mailrc or elm aliases.txt
  - easy piping of message text through unix filters
  - emacs-like key-bindings for text editing
  - emacs-like autosave
  - sorting of messages on any field and the ability to
    write out the folder physically in that order

Description: Small yet powerful program for tape oriented backups.
 tob is a simple yet configurable shell-script which, given a set of 
 `volume definitions', runs tar or afio based backups, either for use 
 with tape drives or floppy disks. You could also mount and unmount 
 partitions for backups in the pre- and postcommands. tob is a general
 driver for the making and maintaining of backups.  It makes full 
 backups, differential backups (of the files which were changed since 
 the last full backup), incremental backups (of files changed since all
 previous backups), lets you determine the size of the backup before 
 actually making it, maintain listings of made backups, make remote 
 backups and possibly more.

 press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the
 Network News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server
 available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing
 just local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you
 can configure trn to access it.

 be made via modems, direct (hard-wired) serial connections or via an IP
 connection.  I have not had the opportunity to experiment with that
 latter method.  If someone out there knows how to set it up, please let
 me know.
 .
 I think that I now have the permission problems taken care of for dial-
 out only ports.  I have not had a chance to test this with bidirectional
 ports.  There is still no automatic configuration.
 .

Description: A mail user agent for Emacs
 VM (View Mail) is an Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read
 and disposed of within Emacs.  Commands exist to do the normal things
 expected of a mail user agent, such as generating replies, saving
 messages to folders, deleting messages and so on.  There are other
 more advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating
 digests, message forwarding, and organizing message presentation
 according to various criteria.

Description: Operate X-10 electrical power control modules.
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .
 You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores,
 but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your
 Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order
 one are included in the documentation of this package.

 xbattle is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of
 strategy with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military
 scenarios.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being
 executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they
 all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of
 players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker
 colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can
 be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate
 the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A
 wide variety of command line options (and previously configured game files)
 provide an abundance of different scenarios and gaming environments.

Description: display colors and names in X
 From the original announcement:
 .
 xcolorsel is a X-Utility based  on this widget that allows you to display such
 files ( /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt by default ) together with tiles showing how the
 color  looks on your screen.  Also a programmer may  (like with xfontsel) cut
 the color names/definitions in various  formats (Colorformats and formats for
 resourcefiles or C-sources) und paste them directly in his source codes.
 .
 xcolorsel has also proven his usefulness for finding nice color sets for setup
 of colors for my favorite X-tools.

 models, to silly but fun games, with time periods ranging from ancient
 history into the distant future.

 it can animate most other fonts that contain all of the digits.  It
 can also do some funky psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use the
 "shape" extension so that the window is shaped like the digits.

Description: A TeX DVI previewer for X11
 xdvi lets you preview TeX's DVI output under the X11
 windowing sytem. It uses the same pixel files as the intended output
 device. The fonts are scaled down to screen resolution using grey
 scales, resulting in readable screen preview even for rather small fonts.
 .
 xdvi understands postscript \special's supported by dvips and
 knows how to call ghostscript to generate the bitmaps corresponding
 to these \special's and display them together with the rest of the
 page. This mostly eliminates the need for ghostview for previewing
 of TeX documents (xdvi is much faster).

Description: Displays an image for each piece of mail in your mailbox.
         XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
    piece of mail in your mail box.  This lets you know at a
    glance who you have mail from.  XFaces starts out (when you
    have no mail) looking like a color xbiff.  As you receive
    mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images.  Some of XFaces
    features:
 .
      - Both mono and color images.
 .
      - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.
 .
      - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server
        currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
        SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.
 .
      - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
        show up once on your display.  This way, if you receive 30 messages
        from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.
 .
      - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
        images and sounds or ignore that mail message compleatly. This
        lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
        mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
        left in your system mailbox.
 .
      - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This
        includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
        list.
 .
      - Support for POP mailboxes.
 .
      - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
        contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priorty
        item needs your attention.
 .
      - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
        so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
        be used.
 .
      - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
        count, user@host, the contents of any header.

     1) access control on all services based on:
        a) address of remote host
        b) time of access
     Access control works on all services, whether multi-threaded or
     single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP protocols.
     All UDP packets can be checked as well as all TCP connections.
     2) Hard reconfiguration:
        a) kills servers for services that are no longer in the
	   configuration file
        b) kills servers that no longer meet the access control criteria
     3) Prevents denial-of-access attacks by
        a) placing limits on the number of servers for each service
	   (avoids process table overflows)
	b) placing an upper bound on the number of processes it will fork
        c) placing limits on the size of log files it creates
     5) Extensive logging abilities:
        a) for every server started it can log:
	  I) the time when the server was started
	  II) the remote host address
          III) who was the remote user (if the other end runs a
	       RFC-931/RFC-1413 server)
	  IV) how long the server was running
	      (I, II and III can be logged for failed attempts too).
        b) for some services, if the access control fails, it can
	   log information about the attempted access (for example,
           it can log the user name and command for the rsh service)
     and more..

Description: Lock X11 display until password is entered.
 xlock locks the X server till the user enters his/her password at the
 keyboard.  While xlock is running, all new server connections are
 refused. The screen saver is disabled. The mouse cursor is turned off.
 The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen. If
 a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
 password of the user who started xlock. xlockmore extends the standard
 xlock program by adding many more modes that are highly configurable.
 .
 Note that under XFree86, the X11 implementation for Linux, Control-
 Alt-Backspace will defeat the locking mechanism and return your
 console back unless you put "DontZap" in your XF86Config file. 'xdm'
 returns to the login prompt. Control-Alt-F1 (among others) will
 defeat locking mechanism with virtual terminals, so make sure that
 you are not logged onto any virtual consoles.

 The Network Time Protocol allows for the synchronization of clocks on

 NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce
 systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of
 syncronizing with even the most precise external time sources.
 .
 The NTP protocol supported by xntpd is defined in RFC's 1059, 1119, and
 1305 for versions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  For more information on how
 NTP works, and how to configure a campus of xntpd daemons, load the optional

Description: Automatic screensaver for X
 The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen
 when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended
 monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like they do
 in the movies.
 .
 The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock and
 xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
 installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
 mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
 invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
 now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
 are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
 about what it means to be a screensaver.
