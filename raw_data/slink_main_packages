 Historically, a2ps started as a text to PostScript converter, but thanks
 to powerful delegations it is able to let you use it for any kind of files,
 ie it can also digest manual pages, dvi files, texinfo, ....
 .
 Among the other most noticeable features of a2ps are:
  - various encodings (all the Latins and others),
  - various fonts (automatic font down loading),
  - various medias,
  - various printer interfaces,
  - various output styles,
  - various programming languages,
  - various helping applications,
  - and various spoken languages.

 centralized backup to a special backup server. Backing up only one
 computer is easily possible, too. Any streaming device can be used
 for writing the data to it, usually this will be a tape
 device. Writing backups is normally done sequentially: The next
 writing to tape goes to the end of the previous write no matter where
 you have restored from in the meantime.
 .
  Features:
  - Authentication of the client is performed before it can take over control
  - Access restriction for the streamer device -> security
  - Client-side per-file compression -> reliability
  - Data stream is written to tape in pieces -> fast finding of files
  - Tape position logging for each file
  - Tape capacity is fully used
  - Full / incremental backups
  - Raw partitions can be backuped
  - Client and Server buffering for maximal throughput is done
 .
 Note: Tk is required if you want to use the graphical configuration
 tool instead of the text configuration tool.

Description: Archive file manipulation program.
 Afio manipulates groups of files, copying them within or between
 filesystems and an afio archive.
 .
 Afio archives are portable as they contain only ASCII-formatted header
 information. Afio makes cpio-format archives.  Afio deals somewhat
 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed
 archives that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.
 .
 Afio is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.

 as packaged, but you may want to modify the configuration to use fewer
 colors.
 .
 AfterStep is a continuation of the BowMan window manager project, but
 the name was changed to reflect the desire that it do more than
 simply emulate and become a valuable window manager in its own right.

 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a

  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages

Description: Arbitrary precision calculator (original name: calc)
 Calc is an arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like
 language. Calc is useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyper and as a
 mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides one with a
 machine independent means of computation. Calc comes with a rich set of
 builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.
 .
 Calc is built on top of the library libcalc that represents numeric values
 as fractions reduced to their lowest terms. This library can also be used
 to add arbitrary precision capabilities to your own programs and is
 available in the Debian package `apcalc-dev'.
 .
 The original name of this package is `calc', but it had to be changed to
 `apcalc' for Debian, because there's already another package called `calc'
 in Debian. Nevertheless, the binary and manpage installed by this package
 are still named `calc'.

Description: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM) on laptops
 On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support
 provides access to battery status information and may help you to
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM
 implementation. APM support has been in the kernel since 1.3.46.
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon that provides logging of the
 battery status, apm(1), a client that prints /proc/apm, xapm(1x), an
 X11 utility that displays a little graph, (and tailf(1) which follows
 the growth of a log file).
 .
 The Debian default kernel does *not* contain APM support, because it causes
 problems on some computers.  So, you need to recompile your kernel
 and enable APM support during configuration; the corresponding questions
 are in the 'Character devices' section.

Description: Linux AWE32 driver source and utilities
 Linux can now support the Sound Blaster 32, and Sound Blaster AWE32, through
 the use of a driver written by Takashi Iwai <iwai@dragon.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>.
 These utilities are the package of AWE32 utilities for use with this driver,
 which manipulate patch files. They are required to load the vital '.SBK', or
 '.SF2' files, which will have been installed with your AWE32 DOS or Win95
 software in \SB16\SFBANK or \Windows\System. This also includes 'gusload',
 for loading GUS-format patches to the AWE32 driver.
 .
 This package installs the source for the AWE32 driver into /usr/src/awedrv.
 In order to use the awe32 driver, you must recompile your kernel, after using
 the install script found in this package to patch these sources into your
 kernel source tree (they can alternatively be manually installed into the
 kernel source or into a separate copy of the sound driver).
 .
 There are also some converters between different patch file formats for the
 AWE32, and the 'sfxtest' program for testing the AWE32 driver, which are
 installed in /usr/lib/awe.

 characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY. You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode. You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes. Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats. While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering. Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file. The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format. Files that are bigger than
 memory can be handled.

 biblook provides an interactive lookup facility using the .bix and .bib
 files.  It verifies that the file version number and bibindex
 version number match its own values, and also compares the file time
 stamps so that it can detect whether the .bix file is out-of-date with
 respect to the .bib file.  In either case, execution terminates.

Description: Bootstrap-only compiler kit for a subset of Java(tm)
 BOCK is a prototype native compiler, originally intended to enable
 a Java(tm) development environment to be bootstrapped from a C-only
 environment.  It was envisioned that its sole purpose in life would be
 to compile the forthcoming "Jackal" Java compiler.
 .
 BOCK has, since then, gained functionality, and should soon be able
 to compile most non-graphical Java programs.  Its lack of anything
 resembling error checking means that it won't be of much use for
 development, but it might be able to generate a reasonably fast binary
 version of your program.
 .
 That said, BOCK is still very much in the pre-alpha testing stage.
 It is therefore unlikely to be of use to anyone except dedicated hackers
 and developers.
 .
 Also included is "jcomp", a slightly more friendly front-end for bock,
 which compiles programs against the BOCK mini-library and compiles
 BOCK's C output to native code in one step.

 addresses are on which side of the Bridge and forwarding only packets
 that are necessary. Linux will work like an Ethernet Switch!

Description: User daemon that tracks URL's looked at and logs them.
 Browser-history came from the will to overcome a Netscape bug: there
 is no global history, and if you close a window, its whole history is
 lost. For people browsing lots of sites, having the possibility of
 backtracking to where one has been before means that you dont have to
 put everything in your bookmarks file. If you are not sure if a site
 may be worth remembering, don't add it in your bookmarks. If you need
 it later, just browse your history files.
 .
 It works with: Netscape Navigator, Mozilla, and Arena.  Support for
 `browser-history' can easily be added to other browsers, provided you
 can program and have the browser sources.
 .
 A manual page and simple documentation will be installed in
 "/usr/doc/browser-history/browser- history.html", along with a simple
 CGI interface to grep the history log and display the result.  The
 optional CGI program requires `cgiwrap' or Apache configured with
 `suexec'.

 splits up the recipients into several groups containing no more than N
 domains each, creates an SMTP envelope for each group of recipients,
 and feeds that envelope to "/usr/lib/sendmail -bs".

Description: A high-quality block-sorting file compressor
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).  If you need to extract old *.bz files,
 please also install the Debian package "bzip".

Description: Graham Stoney's mechanized man page generator
 C2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments from C
 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
 .
 Features:
  * generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or
    HTML format
  * handles comments as part of the language grammar
  * automagically documents enum parameter & return
    values
  * handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
 Problems:
  * doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)

Description: Write audio CD-Rs in disk-at-once mode
 cdrdao creates audio CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven by a
 description file.
 In DAO mode it is possible to create non standard track pre-gaps that
 have other lengths than 2 seconds and contain nonzero audio
 data. This is for example useful to divide live recordings into
 tracks where 2 second gaps would be irritating. It is also possible
 to create hidden tracks or track intros as found on commercial CDs.
 .
 This tool can only produce audio CDs, it is not possible to create
 data tracks.

     * reads/writes/executes outside memory segments
     * free called with address not obtained from malloc
     * free an already freed block
     * ...and many more!
 .
 Checker's main disadvantage is that it causes the program to run many
 times slower.  You can compile your program to use Checker by using
 the command `checkergcc' in place of `gcc'.  Please do read the
 documentation, it contains some important information.

Description: A Perl replacement for Make
 Excerpted from the README file:
 .
 Cons is a system for constructing, primarily, software, but is quite
 different from previous software construction systems. Cons was
 designed from the ground up to deal easily with the construction of
 software spread over multiple source directories. Cons makes it easy
 to create build scripts that are simple, understandable and
 maintainable. Cons ensures that complex software is easily and
 accurately reproducible.
 .
 Cons uses a number of techniques to accomplish all of this.
 Construction scripts are just Perl scripts, making them both easy to
 comprehend and very flexible. Global scoping of variables is replaced
 with an import/export mechanism for sharing information between
 scripts, significantly improving the readability and maintainability
 of each script. Construction environments are introduced: these are
 Perl objects that capture the information required for controlling the
 build process. Multiple environments are used when different semantics
 are required for generating products in the build tree. Cons
 implements automatic dependency analysis and uses this to globally
 sequence the entire build. Variant builds are easily produced from a
 single source tree. Intelligent build subsetting is possible, when
 working on localized changes. Overrides can be setup to easily
 override build instructions without modifying any scripts. MD5
 cryptographic signatures are associated with derived files, and are
 used to accurately determine whether a given file needs to be rebuilt.

Description: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
 of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  It handles multiple
 developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control
 various operations, and can work over a wide area network.  The
 following tasks are not included; they can be done in conjunction with
 CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and software other
 than CVS: bug-tracking, build management (that is, make and make-like
 tools), and automated testing.
 .
 And a whole lot more.  See the manual for more information.

Description: Debian package scripts for CVS source trees.
 This package provides the capability to inject or import Debian
 source packages into a CVS repository, build a Debian package from
 the CVS repository, and helps in integrating upstream changes into
 the repository.
 .
 The import or inject process takes a dsc (Debian source control)
 file, and imports it into CVS. The module path can maintains
 distribution and section information; for example, one may inject
 hemm/hemm/devel/make into the repository.
 .
 The build process works analogously to dpkg-buildpackage, and can be
 used from within the checked out source tree, or with additional
 information, can be used from anywhere. In the latter case, you can
 build any previous version of the package, as long as the
 corresponding orig.tar.gz file is still around. The build script
 checks out the relevant version from the CVS repository, and runs
 dpkg-buildpackage to create the Debian package.
 .
 Combined, these utilities provide an infrastructure to facilitate the
 use of CVS by Debian maintainers. This allows one to keep separate
 CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and possibly
 experimental distributions, along with the other benefits of a
 version control system.
 .
 This can be used to generate a unified CVS source tree, for example.

 CWEB allows you to write documents which can be used simultaneously as

 .
 The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the best
 possible documentation for their programs need two things simultaneously: a
 language like TeX for formatting, and a language like C for programming.
 Neither type of language can provide the best documentation by itself.  But
 when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system that is much more
 useful than either language separately.

 The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a popular graphical user interface
 to UNIX debuggers such as GDB, DBX, XDB, and JDB.  Besides ``usual''
 front-end features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints,
 DDD provides an interactive graphical data display, where data
 structures are displayed as graphs.  Using DDD, you can reason about
 your application by watching its data, not just by viewing it execute
 lines of source code.
 .
 Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in Ada, C,
 C++, Chill, Fortran, Java, Modula, and Pascal; machine-level debugging;
 hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint, backtrace, and
 history editors; preferences and settings editors; program execution
 in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote host; on-line manual;
 interactive help on the Motif user interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line
 interface with full editing, history, and completion capabilities.
 DDD has been designed to compete with well-known commercial debuggers
 and is being used for software development by all major suppliers of
 information technology.
 .
 This version is linked against Lesstif, an LGPL-ed implementation of Motif.

 As a file system is used, data tends to become more and more scattered
 over the disk, degrading performance.  A disk defragmenter simply
 reorganises the data on the disk, so that individual files occupy a
 single sequential set of disk blocks, and all the free space on the
 disk is collected together in a single region.  This generally means
 that reading a whole file is more efficient.

Description: Alternative Debian package manager
 dftp is another program to maintain your Debian installation. It
 downloads the lists of currently available packages via FTP, compares
 them to the installed packages and lets you interactively select
 which new/upgraded packages you want to install. Dependencies of new
 packages are checked and missing packages offered for installing,
 too. Then all selected packages are fetched with FTP and verified for
 correctness. Installation of packages is done via dpkg, and ordered
 by dependencies.
 .
 dftp's main advantage over other interfaces to Debian package
 management is that it can (partially) run on a different machine than
 the target system, if that doesn't have direct FTP access. Scanning
 the current installation and installing packages must of course be
 done on the target system. But package selection and download can be
 moved to a different machine. dftp can also run on non-Debian
 systems. Therefore it is also available as a standalone version (Perl
 script) in /debian/project/misc.

Description: dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP.
 Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone
 lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off.
 diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are
 Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link
 down when it is idle.
 .
 diald operates by starting a SLIP link on a pseudo tty and setting up
 a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the
 proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real
 communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from
 the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it
 needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly
 diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling
 these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup
 files.
 .
 For diald to work the kernel *must* have SLIP devices, either compiled in
 or as a module, even if only PPP connections are made. In the latter case
 you should also have pppd, of course.
 .
 Diald needs a program like "chat" or "expect" to actually dial.
 Sorry, "dip" cannot be used.

Description: Dictionary Server
 Dictd is a TCP based server that allows a client to access dictionary
 definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.
 .
 Eight dictionary databases have been packaged for debian.  They are:
 .
     dict-web1913   - 1913 Webster's Unabridged Dictionary
                 (this package is in the non-free section)
     dict-wn        - WordNet 1.6, A Lexical Database for English
     dict-jargon    - Hacker's Jargon File
     dict-foldoc    - The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing
     dict-elements  - Chemical and Physical Properties of the Elements
     dict-easton    - Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary
     dict-hitchcock - Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary
     dict-gazetteer - Database of Geographic Data from the U.S. Census
 .
 These packages are discussed in more detail in the file
 /usr/doc/dictd/README.Debian.gz
 Either dict-web1913 (non-free) or dict-wn is essential for a useful
 dictionary server.  It is strongly recommended that both be installed.
 It is desirable that either dict-jargon or dict-foldoc, or both of
 them, be installed.
 .
 The client program, dict, is packaged in dict*.deb  If you are
 running a server, you will want the client for all machines in your
 network, and for testing server operations.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: Tools for developing, maintaining and distributing software.
 The dist package is a set of tools meant to ease the construction
 and maintenance of portable software.
 .
 The first component is the Configure script generator, metaconfig, which
 automatically builds the Configure script from your sources. Ideally,
 the end-user receiving your source code will simply have to read
 your README file, run the Configure script (which is self-documented),
 and then run make.
 .
 The second component is the Makefile.SH generator, which is a generic
 configured Makefile, reusing some of the information figured out
 by Configure, and a generic Jmakefile description.
 .
 The third component is the RCS aware package generator, which is
 used when it's time to build up the shell archives used to distribute
 your program.
 .
 The fourth and latest component is the patch generator, used to
 make updates of your sources, which can later be applied on the original
 distribution by using the patch program.

Description: Checks dns zone information using nameserver lookups
 This program analyzes any DNS zone you specify, and reports any problems it
 finds by displaying errors and warnings.  Then it descends recursively to
 examine all zones below the given one (this can be disabled with a command-
 line option).
 .
 You don't have to feed any BIND conffiles to Dlint. Dlint uses
 nameserver calls to gather information.
 .
 Designed for Unix, dlint is written in Bourne Shell and Perl.
 .
 You may try it online at http://www.domtools.com/dlint/
 (this server imposes a timeout period; to lint a big zone, you should
 install dlint yourself and use it locally - that's what this package is for).

Description: Frontends to DNS search.
 This package provides two programs to make user lookups on DNS
 servers: dns_tree and dns_browse.
 .
 dns_tree is a command-line-based front-end to dig.  It replaces the
 several dig invocations necessary to fetch a zone, and it formats the
 output in a somewhat sensible hierarchical style (a tree).
 .
 dns_browse is a GUI front-end to dns_tree.  It allows point-and-click
 DNS browsing and makes it easy to expand/compress hierarchies in one
 or more DNS zones.

 This package provides an online syntax checker for DSSSL style and

 DSSSL standard regarding specification files, composing a specification
 body from one or more files conforming to the DSSSL architectural
 form, then mapping from the specification body (i.e. sequences of
 expression language forms) to a reordered normalised form thereof and
 loading the result into a Scheme interpreter with access to a document
 source grove.
 .
 Comprehensive and detailed error messages, based on a large database
 of information about the calling sequences for all specification
 language functions and forms are logged to stderr, together with
 (optionally) information about feature usage.

 a file system may be restored and subsequent incremental backups layered on
 top of it.  Single files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or
 partial backups.

Description: The headers and static libraries for ext2fs-aware tools-development.
 EXT2FS stands for "Extended Filesystem", version 2. It's the filesystem
 type used for hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and shared libraries needed to compile
 ext2fs-aware programs. Only programmers that really manipulate
 features specific to the ext2 filesystem will need this. Most
 programmers will use the generic filesystem-independent interface
 from libc.
 .
 It also contains dev files for 2 other libs (e2p and uuid) used by
 the e2fsprogs, but which are not yet packaged all by themselves
 because they lack documentation. They may also lack some support
 files, by I can't really know until someone uses them...
 .
 libe2p is for user-level e2fsprogs commands.  It's used by dumpe2fs,
 chattr, and lsattr.  Functions in libe2p typically have two
 characteristics (a) don't require that block device containing the
 filesystem be opened directly (functions in libext2fs do), and (b)
 libe2p typically contains printf statements or parse user input, and so
 have more internationalization issues.
 .
 libuuid generates and parses 128-bit universally unique id's (UUID's),
 using a standard which is blessed by both Microsoft and DCE, and is
 being proposed as an internet standard.  See the internet-draft:
 .
                draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt

 formats. fax, a shell script, provides a simple user interface to the efax
 and efix programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript files as faxes
 and receive, print or preview received faxes.
 .
 You need ghostscript to fax Postscript files. To preview faxes, you need
 a PGM file viewer such as xloadimage.

Description: Advanced IRC robot
 Like most bots, eggdrop sits on a channel and takes protective
 measures: to keep the channel from being taken over (in the few ways
 that anything CAN), to recognize banished users or sites and reject
 them, to recognize privileged users and let them gain ops, etc.
 .
 One of the more unique features of eggdrop is its "party line",
 accessable via DCC chat, which allows you to talk to other people
 lag-free.  Consider it a multi-way DCC chat, or a miniature IRC
 (complete with channels).  You can link up with other bots and

Description: A much improved "vi" editor with syntax highlighting.
 Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor. Elvis supports
 nearly all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and ex mode.
 Elvis adds support for multiple files, multiple windows, a variety
 of display modes, on-line help, and other miscellaneous extensions.
 Because of its html mode, and it ability to do http and ftp, it can now
 also be used as a poor man's web browser!
 .
 Elvis provides color syntax highlighting, with syntax modes for c, c++,
 java, awk, makefiles, perl, postscript, pascal, sh, tcl, vrml, html,
 diffs, man pages, and fortran. If all this isn't enough for you, it is
 easy to add new syntax modes (additions are welcome!). Elvis also has a
 special hex editing mode for directly editing binary data.
 .
 This version of elvis also includes ctags and ref, for quickly navigating
 about your source code.

 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.  (Until now, the only
 option available to visually impaired users has been to use a talking
 PC as a terminal.)  Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once you
 start emacs with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
 everything you do.  Your mileage will vary depending on how well you
 can use Emacs.  There is nothing that you cannot do inside Emacs :-).
 This package includes speech servers written in tcl to support the
 DECtalk Express and DECtalk MultiVoice speech synthesizers.  For
 other synthesizers, look for separate speech server packages.

Description: Modified ircII client with additional functionality
 EPIC is 100% backwards compatible with ircII becuase EPIC *is* ircII.
 EPIC was originally built upon the ircII-2.6 client and has maintained
 faithfulness to remain current up to the 2.8.2 release.
 EPIC is somewhat larger than the stock client (24%), but that is mostly
 because of the multitude of new features, the dual ANSI/K&R compliant
 function headers, and the large amount of re-written code in an attempt
 to make ircii faster, more efficient, and more powerful.

Description: epic irc client, version 4
 epic4 is an irc client based on ircII.  It is primarily suited to users who
 wish to write their own irc scripts or have irc scripts written by others.
 .
 Previous versions of epic were 100% compatible with ircII 2.8.2, though
 this is no longer the case.  Instead we've taken a new direction and chosen
 to find places where compatibility with ircII is undesirable and fix them.
 No gratuitous incompatibilities have been added, though many new features
 have been.

Description: Circumventing Debian package dependencies
 This is a dummy package that makes Debian's package management
 system believe that equivalents to packages on which other
 packages do depend on are actually installed.
 .
 Deinstallation of this package is only possible when all pending
 dependency issues are properly resolved in some other way. A more
 brutal approach for it's deinstallation is to create and install
 'equivs' configured using an empty "/etc/equivs.conf" (or simply
 delete it) to remove all of the existing dependencies with any
 installed package on the system.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used
 might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

 is used by editors like vi and emacsen to allow moving to the
 definition of a user-specified entity.
 .
 This version of ctags is said to be better than others in that it has
 more robust parsing (i.e. more accurate) and recognises more
 languages and types of entity.
 .
 Groks C (both K&R and ANSI), C++, Java.

Description: C malloc debug library
 Provides routines that can be plugged in to replace malloc(),
 realloc(), calloc(), and free().
 .
 If you're not debugging, and an allocation fails, FDA will call user
 supplied callbacks to allow you to free up some memory or shut down
 the program cleanly -- this means you don't have to check the
 return values from malloc if you don't want to.
 .
 For debugging FDA provides a nice toolkit for validating pointers,
 checking for leaks, gathering memory statistics, bounds checking and
 other nice things.  FDA uses shredding, prefix and postfix signatures,
 and a liberal amount of predicate asserts.

Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 This product includes software developed by the University of California,
 Berkeley and its contributors.

 in this update.
 .
 Contained is the source for 2 programs.  dlcicfg and fradcfg will read from
 a configuration file, and create the interfaces with parameters in the
 file.  Once the devices are created, the standard ifconfig can be used to
 assign IP addresses and otherwise configure the device.
 .
 These tools are an alternative to the "wanpipe" package. The package
 might be simpler to configure since it contains only support for Frame
 Relay plus it builds under glibc.

Description: Bundled tests, demos and tools for FreeType
 The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering engine.
 It has been developed to provide TT support to a great variety of platforms
 and environments.
 .
 Note that FreeType is a *library*. It is not a font server for your favorite
 platform, even though it was designed to be used in many of them. Note also
 that it is *not* a complete text-rendering library. Its purpose is simply to
 open and manage font files, as well as load, hint and render individual
 glyphs efficiently. You can also see it as a "TrueType driver" for a
 higher-level library, though rendering text with it is extremely easy, as
 demo-ed by the test programs.
 .
 This package contains several programs bundled with the FreeType engine for
 testing and demonstration purposes, as well as some contributed utilities
 such as ttf2pk, ttf2bdf, ttf2pfb and ttfbanner.

Description: An alternative to anonymous FTP
 In the words of the developers, FSP is what anonymous FTP should have
 been. Basically, FSP is more robust (an intermittent link doesn't faze
 it one bit) and kinder to slow links (the data transfer rate is
 significantly lower) than FTP; this enables a given server to handle
 requests from many more clients than a corresponding FTP server.
 Furthermore, the FSP clients are all run from the command line, storing
 certain information - such as the current directory - in the environment.
 As a consequence, whilst you are downloading a file, you can also be
 browsing other directories of interest.
 .
 From the clients' point of view, FSP allows the access restrictions to be
 lifted, because of the slower transfer rate. (How many times have you had
 "User anonymous access denied" flash at you?) From the servers' point of
 view, much less strain is placed on the network, and because the server
 never forks, the maximum increase in load is one.
 .
 If you want to learn more about FSP, the FSP FAQ is included in
 /usr/doc/fsp; it can also be accessed from the Web address
 http://itu.rdg.ac.uk/misc/fsp/faq/faq.htm
 .
 Two popular FSP sites are ftp.wustl.edu, port 21, and
 fsp.idsoftware.com, also on port 21. Both of these are identical to their
 corresponding FTP sites.

Description: A semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs.
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

 FWEB has grown out of Knuth and Levy's CWEB; it is far more
 configurable and customizable than the original, uses LaTeX to
 typeset documented code, provides a very powerful macroprocessor...
 .
 Ratfor programmers may appreciate the builtin Ratfor-to-Fortran
 translator if they don't have the right compiler.
 .
 Other languages than those cited may be used, but without code
 pretty-printing.

Description: SQL database and parser generator in Python
 Gadfly is a relational database management system which uses a
 large subset of very standard SQL as its query language and Python
 modules and optional Python/C extension modules as its underlying
 engine.  Gadfly stores the active database in memory, with recovery
 logging to a file system. It supports an optional TCP/IP based
 client server mode and log based failure recovery for system or
 software failures (but not for disk failures).
 .
 kwParser, included as part of the Gadfly package, is a parser
 generator for Python.  It transforms an abstract specification of a
 language grammar (for example the CORBA Interface Definition Language)
 together with "interpretation functions" that define the semantics of
 the language into a compiler or translator or interpreter.

 button on a mailbox with new mail will display the Sender and Subject
 of each new message. Additionally, GBuffy will display the X-Face

 to read the mailbox with your favorite mailreader. Pressing the right
 mouse button will bring up the configure menu.

Description: Prints calendars
 Gcal displays a calendar for a month or a year, eternal holiday lists
 and fixed date lists, in many ways. The program correctly omits the
 dates that were skipped when the current Gregorian calendar replaced
 the earlier Julian calendar.
 .
 Apart from the usual and well known calendar functions like the
 output of a month or a year calendar sheet, or the output of an eternal
 holiday list, Gcal offers the facility to display fixed dates on the
 day of their occurrence and to remind or inform the user about them.
 So it's imaginable after booting the computer or starting the work
 session, that the user is informed on screen or by means of electronic
 mail, about all holidays or appointments which are observed or
 scheduled for that day.

 suite that can be configured to work with most UPSs featuring an RS232
 monitoring port.
 .
 Depending on the UPS, cable, and the manner in which the genpower
 package is configured, the genpower package provides the following
 features:
 .
  * Line power sensing
  * Low battery detection
  * Physical cable detection
  * The ability to kill the UPS's inverter
 .
 The Debian package has an extra cable description called "apc-pnp"
 that should support all of the above for the APC Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS,
 and Matrix-UPS systems using the included Windows-95 Plug-and-Play cable!

Description: interactive geometry viewing program
 Geomview is interactive geometry software which is
 particularly appropriate for mathematics research and education.
 In particular, geomview can display things in hyperbolic and
 spherical space as well as Euclidean space.
 .
 Some modules which rely on the libforms library have been removed
 and are available in the package geomview-contrib .
 .
 Geomview allows multiple independently controllable objects and
 cameras.  It provides interactive control for motion, appearances
 (including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an
 object, edge or vertex level, snapshots in SGI image file or
 Renderman RIB format, and adding or deleting objects is provided
 through direct mouse manipulation, control panels, and keyboard
 shortcuts.  External programs can drive desired aspects of the
 viewer (such as continually loading changing geometry or
 controlling the motion of certain objects) while allowing
 interactive control of everything else.

 Forth, as a language, is best known for being stack-based, and completely
 extensible.  Each Forth environment provides one or more dictionaries of
 pre-defined words, and programming in Forth consists of defining and
 executing new words that are combinations of previously defined words.  It
 has been said that learning Forth changes forever the way you think about
 writing programs.

 GLUT (pronounced like the glut in gluttony) is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit,
 a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs.  It
 implements a simple windowing application programming interface (API) for
 OpenGL. GLUT makes it considerably easier to learn about and explore OpenGL
 programming.
 .
 GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs.
 While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL
 applications, GLUT is not a full-featured toolkit so large applications
 requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window
 system toolkits like Motif. GLUT is simple, easy, and small.

Description: Midnight Commander - A powerful file manager. - Gnome version
 Warning: The gnome version from mc is alpha software!
 .
 Midnight Commander is a feature-rich file manager. It has mouse support in
 a linux console and in an xterm. It started as a Norton Commander clone but
 now it is far superior to it. Among other things it can do FTP, includes a
 hexeditor, comes with an internal editor which can be invoked separately as
 'mcedit' and lets you do most system administration tasks.
 Browsing, unpacking and installation of Debian packages is possible by just
 pressing enter on a *.deb file. Handling of other archive formats like rpm,
 zip, zoo and tar.gz is equally supported. This version comes with undelete
 for ext2 filesystems compiled in.
 .
 This Version include the gmc (mc for gnome) too :-)

 distribution.  Tools have been modified to use "gnatgcc" as the driver
 and libgnatgcc instead of libgcc as the support library.
 .

 no longer "diverts" gcc, but installs "gnatgcc" as the gnat compiler.

Description: GTK-based Notepad editor
 This is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple text editor
 for Unix based systems running X11 and using GTK (the Gimp ToolKit).
 Gnotepad+ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, while
 still providing many of the common features found in a modern
 GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially
 for the features it offers, and aims to remain that way.
 .
 The "+" in gnotepad+ is there to differentiate it from other
 GTK-based text editors which may call themselves "gnotepad".
 Additionally, gnotepad+ is not intended to be fancy, so it leverages
 its text editing capabilities on the GTK Text Widget.  Hence, if you
 are looking for a programmers's editor, look for another text editor
 or help improve the GTK Text Widget.

Description: A versatile News and mailing list reader for Emacsen
 Gnus is a message-reading laboratory.  This is by far the most
 powerful and extensible news reader that I am aware of. It will let
 you look at just  about anything as if it were a newsgroup.  You can
 read mail with it,  you can browse directories with it, you can ftp
 with it---you can even read news with it! It handles single file
 groups, MH format folders, mbox files, digests, knows about POP,
 etc. It can split incoming mail ala procmail.
 .
 Instead of boring old KILL files, it has an adaptive multifaceted
 scoring mechanism -- you add or reduce the score of the article based
 on rules, and a component of the score comes in from your past
 behaviour -- for example, articles similar to ones you read and saved
 get higher scores. This adaptive mechanism is one fo the most
 interesting part of Gnus.
 .
 Gnus tries to empower people who read news the same way Emacs
 empowers people who edit text.  Gnus sets no limits to what the user
 should be allowed to do.  Users are encouraged to extend Gnus to make
 it behave like they want it to behave.  A program should not control
 people; people should be empowered to do what they want by using (or
 abusing) the program.

Description: A generic audio mixer (Base versions)
 gom is a generic audio mixer program; it tries to provide a complete
 and convenient interface for all kind of audio mixer manipulation.
 gom's facilities include sound driver (compile time) and sound card
 (run time) independence, arbitrary mixer selection, loading and saving
 of mixer settings, volume fading, verbosity-level driven output,
 "Un*x-like scripting support", etc.
 .
 At the moment, gom only supports the Open Sound System (OSS) sound
 driver. OSS comes with the Linux kernel as free software called
 OSS/Free, and is available for a number of other platforms.
 .
 Apart from the exhaustive command line interface described here, gom
 optionally has two built-in interactive interfaces (that I call
 gomiis, gom interactive interfaces;): a terminal gomii using ncurses,
 and a X gomii using the xview toolkit.  All gomiis support adjustable
 (this includes disabling) real time updating.

 "Grafix" is a utility originally designed to help scientists in the

 It can be used, however, for any application that wants to use X for
 drawing pictures, functions or other graphic objects in a convinient
 interactive manner or even for writing a graphical user interface for any task.
 .
 Grafix should be considered as a layer between an application and the X Window
 system built up of a bunch of basic classes as building elements.
 The simplest way of using it is to define instances of these classes.
 For more complicated programs the user has to define own derivations to the
 basic classes.

 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: The GNUstep Database Library
 [This is a developer snapshot. Do not use it for production.]
 .
 The GNUstep Database Library is a hierarchy of Objective-C classes
 that provide a three-tiered architecture for developing database
 applications.
 .
 The three-tier architecture is a flexible paradigm for building
 robust and scalable client/server applications; the three tiers refer
 to the database, the Application Objects, and the user interface.  The
 separation of the database from the user interface through intermediary
 Application Objects allows the data to be distributed appropriately
 across database servers and still have the user interface display data
 cohesively for the end-user.  Business logic, as implemented in the
 Application Objects, provides the mechanism for consistency and
 reusability across all your business applications.
 .
 Entity-relationship modelling is used for describing the Application
 Objects and how they are mapped to database fields.  The GNUstep
 Database Library represents these models as plain ASCII text files; this
 allows external programs to be used for constructing and maintaining the
 models separate from the applications which use them.

Description: A PostScript and PDF viewer for X using 3d Athena Widgets
 `gv' is a comfortable viewer of PostScript and PDF files for the X
 Window System.
 .
 From version 3.0 on `gv' cannot be used with the standard Athena
 Widget library.  Nevertheless you do not have to use the 3d Widgets
 for anything else as this version is compiled using `-rpath
 /usr/X11R6/lib/Xaw3d'.
 .
 It uses the `ghostscript' PostScript(tm) interpreter and is based
 on the classic X front-end for `gs', `ghostview'. It is more
 comfortable and more powerful than `ghostview'.
 .
 Some features as e.g. PDF files or anti-aliasing are only supported
 if a recent ghostscript (4.0 or later) is installed.  With
 anti-aliasing turned on, the text is very crisp and readable, with no
 `stepping' on the slants at all.

 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet and allow you
 to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that is plugged
 into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of wall
 switches to control lights, fans, and many other appliances.
     This package supports the CM11A Interface (from Radio Shack), which
 supports two-way communication.  This allows for devices such as motion
 detectors to trigger scripts on your system, turning lights on, updating
 web pages, or send you e-mail.

 HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML documents with
 Python scripts. It's used when you want to create HTML pages
 containing information which changes from time to time. For example
 you might want to have a page which provides an overall system summary
 of data collected nightly. Or maybe you have a catalog of data and
 images that you would like formed into a spiffy set of web pages for
 the world to browse. Python is a great scripting language for these
 tasks and with HTMLgen it's very straightforward to construct objects
 which are rendered into consistently structured web pages. Of course,
 CGI scripts written in Python can take advantage of these classes as
 well.

 into HTML. Rather, it provides an authoring environment for writing
 printed documents and HTML documents at the same time, using an
 extended subset of Latex (excluding concepts that have no HTML
 counterpart and adding commands for new HTML concepts such as
 hyperlinks or included images).

 generally run faster than those of the icont/iconx Icon interpreter. On the
 other hand, the Icon compiler takes much longer to compile programs and is
 more memory-hungry than the iconx/icont pair. As such, the compiler is
 probably only useful to speed up the execution of large Icon programs once
 they are fully developed and debugged.

 Imagemagick is a set of programs to manipulate various image formats
 (JPEG, TIFF, PhotoCD, PBM, XPM, etc...). All manipulations can
 be achieved through shell commands as well as through a X11 graphical
 interface (display).
 .
 Possible effects: colormap manipulation, channel operations, thumbnail
 creation, image annotation, limited drawing, image distortion, etc...
 .
 Imagemagick requires the libmagick4g package to be installed. Libmagick
 comes in two flavors, a free version (without the LZW compression algorithm
 used in GIFs), and a non-free version (with the patented LZW compression
 algorithm).
 .
 This package suggests a postscript interpreter (gs) to read postscript
 files. It will however function happily without it (as long as you don't

 If you do install imapd you will almost certainly want to install a
 Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail
 programs which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will
 usually want to send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.
 .
 You will probably also want to install Pine or some other IMAP client
 so that you can test your IMAP server.

Description: Add WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes to IMG tags in HTML files.
 The imgsizer script automates away the tedious task of creating and
 updating the extension HEIGHT and WIDTH parameters in HTML IMG tags.
 These parameters help many browsers (including Netscape) to multi-thread
 image loading, instead of having to load images in strict sequence in
 order to have each one's dimensions available so the next can be placed.
 This generally allows text on the remainder of the page to load much
 faster.

Description: News transport system `InterNetNews' by the ISC and Rich Salz
 INN is Debian's preferred news transport system.
 .
 The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles
 and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides
 those articles on request to users.  It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites.  Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as `expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn.  The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again.  It also provides the posting interface for the user.

Description: Initializes IP Masquerade firewalling/forwarding
 This package contains scripts to initialize IP Masquerade, a feature
 of Linux that allows an entire network of computers to be connected
 to another network (usually the Internet) with only one network
 address on the other network.  IP Masquerade is often referred to as
 NAT (Network Address Translation) on other platforms.
 .
 The package by default configures the system for a basic forwarding
 firewall, with IP spoofing and stuffed routing protection.  However,
 ipmasq now features a very flexible framework whereby you can override
 any of the predefined rules if you so choose.  It also allows you to
 control if the rules are reinterpreted when pppd brings a link up or
 down.
 .
 IP Masquerade requires the kernel to be compiled with CONFIG_FIREWALL,
 CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL, CONFIG_IP_FORWARD, and CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE.

Description: IP Port Forwarding
 This package contains a tool to forward connections to hosts on your

 be reached from the Internet. IP Port Forwarding makes it possible to
 make individual ports on the private networks reachable from the outside.
 .
 IP Port Forwarding does address rewriting for that purpose and is much
 faster and cleaner than any redirection program I have seen.
 .

Description: Jim Plank's program for producing PostScript graphs
 Jgraph takes a description of a graph or graphs
 and produces a postscript file on the standard output.
 .
 Jgraph is ideal for plotting any mixture of scatter point graphs, line
 graphs, and/or bar graphs, and embedding the output into LaTeX, or
 any other text processing system which can read postscript.
 .
 The graph description language is simple enough to get nice looking
 graphs with a minimum of effort, yet powerful enough to give the user
 the flexibility to tailor the appearance of the graph to his or her
 individual preferences.  This includes plotting multiple graphs and
 laying them out separately on the page (or pages).

 jless is a program similar to  more(1),  but  which  allows
 backward  movement  in the file as well as forward movement.
 Also, jless does not have  to  read  the  entire  input  file
 before starting, so with large input files it starts up fas-
 ter than text editors like vi(1).  jless  uses  termcap  (or
 terminfo  on  some  systems),  so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.
 .
 jless supported ISO 2022 code extension techniques and
 Japanese codes.

 If you wish to update a bootdisk, or to use a bootloader to make
 installing and using the image easier, we suggest you install the latest
 fdutils (for formatting a floppy to be used as boot disk), and LILO, for a
 powerful bootloader. Of course, both these are optional.

Description: Debian Linux kernel package build scripts.
 This package provides the capability to create a debian
 kernel-image package by just running make-kpkg kernel_image in a
 kernel source directory tree.  It can also build the kernel source
 package as a debian file, the kernel headers package. In general, this
 package is very useful if you need to create a custom kernel, if, for
 example, the default kernel does not support some of your hardware, or
 you wish a leaner, meaner kernel.
 .
 If you are running on an intel x86 platform, and you wish to compile a
 custom kernel (why else are you considering this package?), then you may
 need the package bin86 as well.  (This is not required on other platforms).

Description: LaTeX to HTML translator.
 LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts documents written
 in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration
 path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar
 word-processing concepts.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document.
 .
 Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the
 LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format. The default is
 PNG.
 .
 Please note that there are certain legal limitations on the use of
 the GIF image format. Also, LaTeX2HTML would depend on netpbm-non-free,
 which is in section non-free, if the default image style is changed to be
 GIF.

Description: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
 class, which is part of the libwww-perl package. This is the
 replacement for the now obsolete CGI-modules package.
 .
 This package is destined to replace libcgi-pm-perl, but at the moment
 libcgi-pm-perl (as in the library CGI.pm) serves as the rapid
 prototyping version, and may be more featureful than this package.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation.

Description: C library for developing CGI applications (libc5 version)
 Cgic is an ANSI-C library for the creation of CGI-based World Wide Web
 applications.  Cgic provides the following:
 .
   * Parses form data, correcting for defective and/or inconsistent
     browsers
   * Transparently accepts both GET and POST form data
   * Handles line breaks in form fields in a consistent manner
   * Provides string, integer, floating-point, and single- and
     multiple-choice functions to retrieve form data
   * Provides bounds checking for numeric fields
   * Loads CGI environment variables into C strings which are always
     non-null
   * Provides a way to capture CGI situations for replay in a debugging
     environment
 .
 This package provides a shared library version of cgic for libc5.

Description: Perl5 modules for common date and time manipulation
 The libdatemanip-perl package (which corresponds to the CPAN package
 DateManip) provides Perl modules designed to make any common date/time
 manipulation easy to do.  Operations such as comparing two times,
 calculating a time a given amount of time from another, or parsing
 international times are all easily done.  From the very beginning, the main
 focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired date/time
 operation easily, not necessarily quickly.  There are other modules that
 can do a small subset of the operations available in Date::Manip much
 quicker than those presented here, so if speed is a primary issue, you
 should look elsewhere.  Check out the CPAN listing of Time and Date
 modules.  But for sheer flexibility, I believe that Date::Manip is your
 best bet.

Description: Perl library for accessing dates
 The package provides a Perl interface to a C library which offers a
 wide variety of date calculations based on the Gregorian calendar
 (the one used in all western countries today), complying with the
 ISO/R 2015-1971 and DIN 1355 standards which specify things as what
 leap years are, when they occur, how the week numbers are defined,
 what's the first day of the week, how many weeks (52 or 53) a given
 year has, and so on.
 .
 Although the Gregorian calendar was only adopted 1582 by most (not
 all) European countries (some countries continued to use the Julian
 calendar until as late as the beginning of the 20th century!), this
 package allows you to extrapolate the Gregorian calendar back until
 the year 1.

 Fltk is an attractive, fast, and flexible graphic user interface toolkit, that

 should be easy to port Forms programs to Fltk.
 .
 It also includes a very nice user interface designer to write UI code for you.
 .
 Hopefully otherwise free programs which depend on the non-free libForms
 library will be ported to fltk. Then they can go into the main Debian

Description: Garbage collecting allocator (plug-in malloc replacement)
 The Boehm GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc.
 .
 Since the collector does not require pointers to be tagged, it does
 not attempt to ensure that all inaccessible storage is reclaimed.
 However it has typically been more successful at reclaiming unused
 memory than most C programs using explicit deallocation.  Unlike
 manually introduced leaks, the amount of unreclaimed memory typically
 stays bounded.

Description: GNU dbm database routines (runtime version). [libc6 version]
 GNU dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible
 hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.
 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).

 WARNING:
 .
 GGI is experimental, and is not yet finished.  The current Debian
 packages are based on snapshots of the GGI codebase, which is undergoing
 active development.  There is no guarantee of binary compatibility, even
 between shared libraries with the same soname.  You are encouraged to
 experiment with GGI in its present state -- the API is fairly complete
 and stable.  However, it is probably not yet a good idea to depend on
 it for anything more critical than a graphics demo, since details of
 both the implementation and interfaces are being tweaked and fine-tuned
 constantly, and merely upgrading a target or shared library is likely
 to break any applications linked against LibGGI.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries for libGGI, the lowest-level
 drawing library provided by GGI.  Also included are libGGI drivers for
 these targets:
 .
  "memory" draws into hidden in-memory framebuffers
  "multi" draws output onto multiple displays simultaneously
  "tile" combines several displays into a single logical display
  "sub" draws output into a subwindow on another target
  "file" draws into a specially formatted file (?)
  "tele" draws on a remote teleserver (?)
 .
 Since none of the targets included here are, alone, capable of real,
 physical graphics output, you'll probably need to install at least one
 of the libggi-target packages to make any kind of sensible use of libGGI.

Description: User binaries for a GSM speech compressor.
 Contains user binaries for libgsm, an implementation of the European
 GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding,
 prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long
 term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: Library for embedding perl in HTML
 Embperl allows you to embed perl code in your HTML documents. The
 code can be used to compute something (e.g. retrieve data from a
 database) or to produce output (e.g. display a variable). Also some
 metacommands are available which give you the ability to create
 "loops" or to conditional process your HTML document. As fours
 feature some HTML tags are specially interpreted. This allows dynamic
 table creation and an easier form processing.
 .
 Embperl can run offline, as CGI script or as module using mod_perl of
 the Apache httpd (which is the fastest approach).

 Image::Size is a library based on the image-sizing code in the wwwimagesize
 script, a tool that analyzes HTML files and adds HEIGHT and WIDTH tags to
 IMG directives. Image::Size has generalized that code to return a raw (X, Y)
 pair, and included wrappers to pre-format that output into either HTML or
 a set of attribute pairs suitable for the CGI.pm library by Lincoln Stein.
 Currently, Image::Size can size images in XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF
 and the PPM family of formats (PPM/PGM/PBM).

Description: Generates recursive-descent parsers in Perl
 The Perl module Parse::RecDescent, incrementally generates top-down
 recursive-descent text parsers from simple yacc-like grammar
 specifications.  It provides:
 .
   * Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens),
   * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule,
   * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within productions,
   * Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules
   * Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar,
   * Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing,
   * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular productions
     during a parse,
   * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse),
   * The ability to retrieve the generated parsing code.
 .
 Also included in this package is the module Text::Balanced, used for
 extraction of delimited text sequences from strings.

 libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring.
 Applications include network statistics collection, security monitoring,
 network debugging, etc.  Since almost every system vendor provides a
 different interface for packet capture, and since we've developed
 several tools that require this functionality, we've created this
 system-independent API to ease in porting and to alleviate the need
 for several system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.

Description: Tcl/Objective-C Interface Library.
 libtclobjc is a library of Objective-C objects and support functions for
 communicating between Objective-C and Tcl/Tk.  From Tcl you can send
 messages to Objective-C objects and get textual representations of
 what's returned.  Thus it provides a way to interactively type messages
 and see the results, all inside the rich structure of the Tcl scripting
 language--almost an Objective-C interpreter.  The library also provides
 an Objective-C object that will forward all of its messages to the Tcl
 interpreter in textual format.

Description: Tricks with shared libs: transparent VPATH and Fake root priv.
 With libtricks you can:
  1) Have your VPATH understood not just by GNUmake, but _every_ program,
  2) Fake root privileges (useful for building Debian packages as non-root)
  3) Create warnings for suspicious writes to /tmp,
  4) Use your imagination to do a _lot_ more (make your CD-ROM appear
     writable, ...).
 The VPATH implemented in libtricks is a _lot_ more general than that of
 GNU make. The VPATH mechanism works for open()-ed files, but also
 for exec(), chown(), etc. What directories are searched when you
 do a open(filename) can be made to depend on (amongs others):
   - Whether the filename matches a certain regular expression,
   - The mode the file is opened with,
   - The filemode in the searched dir ('skip files that are read-only etc')
 The fakeroot implemented in libtricks is directly derived from the older
 debian fakeroot package (but much smaller, faster, easier to debug, ...)
 .
 If you don't understand any of this, you do not need libtricks!

Description: Window Maker's own widget set
 WINGs Is Not GNUstep (WINGs) is a small widget set with the N*XTStep
 look and feel. It's API is inspired in OpenStep and it's
 implementation borrows some ideas from Tk. It has a reasonable set of
 widgets, sufficient for building small applications like a CDPlayer
 or hacking something like rxvt.
 .
 From the author: "The library is limited and it's design is a little
 sloppy, so it's not intended to build large or complex applications,
 like Word Processors although I think it would not be impossible to do
 that. GNUstep should be used for such applications.
 .
 Since WINGs is written in C and is sort of low-level it is small and
 faster than say, Motif or even Athena. Knowing Xlib will help you to
 workaround some of it's limitations, although you'll probably be able
 to write something like a trivial tic-tac-toe game without knowing
 much Xlib."
 .
 Some of it's functions are designed to support the Window Maker window
 manager (see http://windowmaker.org/) but Window Maker is not required
 to use applications written with WINGs. You can probably use such
 apps with any other window manager.

 directly high.
 .
 LOADLIN also can load out of Virtual-86 mode (which is normal when
 using EMS drivers) if a VCPI server is present.

Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX.
 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing
 commands to control the formatting - and produces a PostScript file
 (though it can also produce formatted plain text output).
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and
 it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout than in
 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

Description: An automatic mail-processing tool
 Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has
 far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure
 (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing
 tool, this slices, it dices, it ...
 .
 Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward
 messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post
 the message to a newsgroup.
 .
 It is also possible to process messages containing some commands.
 .
 You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically
 answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the
 Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to
 be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
 substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into
 your vacation message, for a more personalized reply.
 .
 You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the
 lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing.
 .
 The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called
 via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That
 means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You
 also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts.
 .
 It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by
 implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded
 when used.

Description: mail delivery agent with filtering abilities
 maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent. maildrop
 reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers the message to
 your mailbox. maildrop knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style mailboxes,
 and maildirs. "maildir" is a mailbox format used by the Qmail MTA.
 .
 maildrop can optionally read instructions from a file on how to filter
 incoming mail, and, based upon the instructions, deliver mail to alternate
 mailboxes, or forward it to somewhere else, like procmail. Unlike procmail,
 maildrop uses a structured filtering language that's a bit easier on the
 eyes.

 administer his or her list entirely from the web.
 .
 Mailman also integrates most things people want to do with mailing
 lists, including archiving, mail <-> news gateways, and so on.  It
 has all of the features you expect from such a product, plus
 integrated support for the web (including web based archiving),
 automated bounce handling and integrated spam prevention.

 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.

Description: a conversation simulator that can learn as you talk to it
 Conversation simulators are computer programs which give the appearance of
 conversing with a user in natural language.  Such programs are effective
 because they exploit the fact that human beings tend to read much more
 meaning into what is said than is actually there; we are fooled into reading
 structure into chaos, and we interpret non-sequitur as valid conversation.
 .
 MegaHAL differs from conversation simulators such as Eliza in that it uses
 a Markov Model to learn how to hold a conversation. It is possible to
 teach MegaHAL to talk about new topics, and in different languages.

 It is assumed that the message has reached its point of final
 delivery and at that point 8-bit text types can be handled
 natively.  Hence, the need for transfer-encodings is not present
 any more.
 .
 Only some cases are handled:
  - encoded header fields are decoded from QP or B encoding.
  - The charset is assumed to be iso-8859-1
  - part or subparts of content-type text only are decoded
  - all other content-types are passed transparently.

Description: GNU Nana -- improved support for assertions and logging
 GNU Nana is a freely available library providing improved support for
 assertions and logging in GNU C/C++.  In particular:
 .
    * Space/time efficient assertion checking
    * Space/time efficient program loggin
    * Code-to-HTML converter giving only details of your interface
      and pre/postconditions (similar to Eiffel short form).
    * Statement and function-level tracing under GDB.
    * Logging via inline C code (as in <asser.h>) or by extraction of
      commands for gdb which results in no performance cost
      unless running in the debugger.
 .
 It was written by the author because he has written too many of these
 systems in the past for individual projects and has finally gotten tired
 of it.

 implementation of the interface.  The netCDF library also defines a
 machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
 Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
 access, and sharing of scientific data.

 Nethack is a wonderfully silly, yet quite addicting, Dungeons and
 Dragons-style adventure game. You play the part of a fierce fighter,
 wizard, or any of many other classes, fighting your way down to
 retrieve the Amulet of Yendor (try saying THAT one backwards!) for
 your god. On the way, you might encounter a quantum mechanic or two,
 or perhaps a microscopic space fleet, or -- if you're REALLY lucky --
 the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
 .
 The Debian package of Nethack includes spoiler files, to be read only
 in sheer desperation, in /usr/doc/nethack/spoilers.
 .
 A few utilities -- recover, for retrieving your auto-save files in case
 of a power failure, and dgn_comp and lev_comp, two utilities for making
 your own Nethack levels and dungeons, have been included in
 /usr/lib/games/nethack. 'recover' will be run every time your system
 boots, if there are any auto-save files available.

Description: NMAP -- The Network Mapper
 nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine
 for single hosts.  The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap was
 TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It).  This is the Perl slogan, but
 it is equally applicable to scanners.  Sometimes you need speed, other times
 you may need stealth.  In some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required.
 Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different protocols (UDP,
 TCP, ICMP, etc.).  You just can't do all this with one scanning mode.  And
 you don't want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different
 interfaces.  Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know
 into nmap.  Specifically, nmap supports:
 .
        Vanilla TCP connect() scanning,
        TCP SYN (half open) scanning,
        TCP FIN (stealth) scanning,
        TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning
        SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters),
        UDP recvfrom() scanning,
        UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning,
        ICMP scanning (ping-sweep), and
        Reverse-ident scanning.
 .
 nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as
 dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel
 port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings, and flexible
 target and port specification.

 This version of nn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the
 Network News Transfer Protocol), and can make use of your NNTP
 server's NOV database, if configured.  You must have a news server
 available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server.  (For
 those familiar with 'nn', this is a client-only version.)
 .
 (Having recently used both nn and trn, I think it's a toss-up as to
 which is best, as trn seems to include many of nn's best features.
 If you're a diehard nn user, "trn -x -XX" will start trn in a mode
 which somewhat resembles nn.)

Description: a Relational Database Management System for Unix.
 NoSQL is a fast, portable, relational database management system without
 arbitrary limits, (other than memory and processor speed) that runs under,
 and interacts with, the UNIX Operating System.
 .
 It uses the Operator/Stream DBMS paradigm described in "Unix Review",
 March, 1991, page 24, entitled "A 4GL Language".  There are a number of
 "operators" that each perform a unique function on the data.  The "stream"
 is suplied by the UNIX Input/Output redirection mechanism.  Therefore each
 operator processes some data and then passes it along to the next operator
 via the UNIX pipe function.  This is very efficient as UNIX pipes are
 implemented in memory.  NoSQL is compliant with the "Relational Model".
 Read the document "4gl.ps", included with the distribution, for further
 details.

 following advantages:
 .
   - Use a superior plotting package, having access to dozens of
     plotting commands, enabling you to customize your plots at your
     will.
 .
   - Still use the same plot commands that you are familiarized, if you
     really want to.
 .
   - Have some new and long waited ploting command scripts.
 .
 Besides having acess to all PLplot API commands, and all Octave usual
 commands, some with some improvements, new commands are
 available. They are: autostyle, ginput, gtext, legend, cmap, pldef,
 save_fig, set_view, shade, stripc, stripc_add, stripc_del, tdeblank,

Description: Online Mirror Daemon
 Duplicates directory hierarchies between several machines.
 The omirr package consists of the online mirror daemon in.omirrd and a
 kernel patch.  The daemon supports mirroring of directory hierarchies
 between several machines.  It distributes files, file contents and
 file attributes to remote machines, comparable to the rdist(1)
 program, but it has several differences compared to rdist.
 .
 Firstly, it synchronizes the files online, usually immediately, using
 an interface to the local kernel which notifies the daemon about all
 file system modifications. This results in equivalent file system
 contents of the mirrored hierarchies on all machines. The daemon is
 started once, usually at boot time and then runs continuously. In
 contrast, the rdist program is started manually or from cron, then
 distributes its files and terminates.
 .
 Secondly, it allows symmetric mirroring. With rdist, one file system
 hierarchy is the master version used to update the others. The
 hierarchies synchronized by in.omirrd are all treated equally,
 i.e. there is no master copy. The file system modifications are
 time-stamped and in.omirrd uses the latest version of each file. This
 is the same as concurrently modifying the same file from two Unix
 processes: the last modification takes effect. But, since in.omirrd
 does not support file (or even record) locking, it should not be used
 for file system hierarchies with a lot of concurrent updates on
 several machines or for files usually accessed using locking
 mechanisms, like database files.
 .
 Thirdly, it can synchronize several remote machines concurrently.
 rdist updates multiple hosts sequentially.

Description: start a program on a new virtual terminal (VT)
 Open opens a new vt and runs a command on it. It can be used as a simple
 way to start several console logins without having to type your passwd
 on each VT in turn. open can be used as a simpler to use replacement for
 the doshell(8) command.
 .
 open is similar in functionality to the AIX/RS6000 command of the same name.

Description: Options Parsing Tool shared library
 opt is a subroutine library which facilitates the convenient input
 of parameters to a C program. Parameters are parsed from a command
 line, with further facilities for reading options from files, from
 environment strings, or from an interactive environment. The aim of
 the opt package is to permit programs to be both user- and
 programmer- friendly. The package attempts to on the one hand
 provide a direct and relatively full-featured input interface to the
 ultimate user of the program, and at the same time impose a minimal
 amount of work on the programmer to "attach" the package to his or
 her software. It is similar to GNU's (and AT&T's old) getopts
 package, but with a different interface that might be easier to use.

 otp  creates  key  and password lists for verification and

 any length, consist of digits or letters (capital or lower
 case), and alphabetic passwords  can  either  be  entirely
 random (most secure) or obey the digraph statistics of En-
 glish text (easier to remember when transcribing, but less
 secure).
 .
 For  computer  applications,  for  example  one-time login
 passwords, otp can create a file containing the MD5 signa-
 ture of each of the generated keys.  This permits the com-
 puter to verify keys without the need to store the keys in
 plaintext.

 on the local disk and on the device.
 .
 PalmPython includes a set of classes which provide access to
 local and remote PalmOS databases, with support for applications
 including Address, Datebook, Memo, To Do, MoneyManager, Doc,
 and XWord.  It also includes a conduit management API and a
 set of basic conduits.
 .
 PalmPython should be considered "stable beta" software -- it
 works, but is still under active development and new features
 are being added on a regular basis.

 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded

 can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare.
 .
 Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
 includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card
 manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events,
 loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping''
 of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in
 the pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package, where <kernel version> is
 the version of the kernel for which the modules have been compiled.

 PCMCIA Card Services applications program interface.  They have been
 compiled to be compatible with the kernel in the kernel-image-2.0.34
 package version 2.0.34-4.  If you have compiled your own kernel,
 you will most likely need to also recompile the PCMCIA modules.
 The pcmcia-source package has been provided to help Debian users
 recompile the PCMCIA modules to work with their kernels' configurations.
 (It also is possible to rebuild these modules using the Debian source
 files for the pcmcia-cs package.)
 .
 The utilities in the pcmcia-cs package are required to use these
 modules.

 .
 Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
 is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
 machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
 variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
 etc., and is the login shell of ~4500 users.

Description: The perl data language. Perl extensions for numerics.
 PDL (``Perl Data Language'') gives standard perl the ability to COMPACTLY
 store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays
 which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  The idea
 is to turn perl in to a free, array-oriented, numerical language
 in the same sense as commerical packages like IDL and MatLab. One
 can write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays
 all at once. For example, using PDL the perl variable $a can hold a
 1024x1024 floating point image, it only takes 4Mb of memory to store
 it and expressions like $a=sqrt($a)+2 would manipulate the whole image
 in a few seconds.
 .
 A simple interactive shell (perldl) is provided for command line use
 together with a module (PDL) for use in perl scripts.

MD5sum: 7632ed20d0842fbe40ebb33d1d86aa8e
Description: A Package dependency checker and install ordering tool
 It does dependency checks, if you wish. It knows the difference
 between installed, new (and available) packages, and the relationship
 fields (pre-depends, depends, recommends, and suggests). (For
 example, the current packages list need not be read in unless you
 want dependency checks; you may already have done that and now merely
 wish an ordering). It comes with a Test::Harness test suite, to
 protect the world against my typos. Oh, it knows about epochs as well
 if your dpkg does. This could be the basis of mass compiling the
 packages on a new architecture, or to build a release from scratch.
 .
 It creates associative arrays of currently installed packages
 (/var/lib/dpkg/status), and new packages (given a packages file at
 the command line). Then, in the checking dependency phase, for each
 package in the new packages list, it looks at the dependencies, and
 ensure that each dependency is satisfied in either the new list or
 the installed list. If the directive is satisfied from the list of
 new packages, that package is added to the list of packages to be
 topographically sorted. It understands Pre-Depends and will insert
 breaks into the sorted list to separate the installation process into
 separate runs as required to satisfy Pre-Dependencies.
 .
 All this is a set of perl5 libraries, so people may use the API in
 their own scripts.

 are available as separate packages, plplot-tcl and python-plplot
 respectively).
 .
 A program for rendering Tektronix vector files is also included in

Description: Keeps a ppp connection alive
 PPPupd, is a simple daemon which maintains a dialup PPP connection.
 PPPupd is able to:
        + Execute a redial script, should the connection drop.
 .
        + Send out periodic pings to keep a connection up, which might
        be disconnected by unruly ISP's who kick their well paying
        members off, after a predetermined number of minutes of
        inactivity.
 .
        + Send logs to stdout, a log file, or syslog, or all three.
 .
 PPPupd's real strength lies in the ability to configure it easily.
 Upon startup, pppupd will read the contents of a configuration file
 (pppupd.cf by default) and execute scripts, ping, or whatever accordingly.
 .
 Note:  ppp itself has some of the same features so you may want to look
 into that first before installing another daemon.  However if ppp's
 persistant features don't work for you (they don't for me) pppupd might
 be useful.

  ethernet, battery life stats.
 .

 for situations where you have a URL on one display, and want to access
 it with a browser running on another display.  You can select the URL,
 click "propagate", move over to the other display, and then paste into
 the browser.
 .
 If you have the two displays on the same desk, you might be more

Description: An Emacs major mode for editing SGML documents.
 PSGML is a major mode for editing SGML documents.  It contains a
 simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. (The most popular
 nowadays are the HTML DTD's. This package turns your emacs into the
 one of most powerful HTML editors and will be ultimately flexible as
 well, since you could upgrade your editor by just installing new
 DTD's). Functions provided includes menus and commands for inserting
 tags with only the contextually valid tags, identification of
 structural errors, editing of attribute values in a separate window
 with information about types and defaults, and structure based
 editing.
 .
 Since psgml parses the DTD to allow you to edit SGML documents, you do
 need to have the DTD's installed in order to use psgml. Since psgml
 installs itself as an HTML mode in Emacs, it depends on sgml-data. Some
 other packages which also provide SGML DTD's are suggested, like
 debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-sgml.
 .
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO
 standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office
 systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)".
 .
 This is a standard package for XEmacs.

Description: Improves integration between Python and C++ classes
 A lightweight mechanism, named "ExtensionClass",
 http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/ExtensionClass-1.0.2.tar.gz,
 has been developed for making Python
 extension types more class-like.  Classes can be developed in an
 extension language, such as C or C++, and these classes can be
 treated like other python classes:
 .
  - They can be sub-classed in python,
  - They provide access to method documentation strings, and
  - They can be used to directly create new instances.
 .
 An example class shows how extension classes are implemented and how
 they differ from extension types.
 .
 Extension classes provide additional extensions to class and
 instance semantics, including:
 .
  - A protocol for accessing subobjects "in the context of" their
    containers.  This is used to implement custom method types
    and environmental acquisition.
  - A protocol for overriding method call semantics.  This is used
    to implement "synchronized" classes and could be used to
    implement argument type checking.
  - A protocol for class initialization that supports execution of a
    special '__class_init__' method after a class has been
    initialized.
 .
 Extension classes illustrate how the Python class mechanism can be
 extended and may provide a basis for improved or specialized class
 models.

 These extensions add two new object types to Python, and then include
 a number of extensions that take advantage of these two new objects:
 .
  - Multidimensional Array Objects
    * Efficient arrays of homogeneous machine types (floats, longs,
      complex doubles, ?)
    * Arbitrary number of dimensions
    * Sophisticated structural operations
  - Universal Function Objects
    * Supports mathematical functions on all python objects
    * Very efficient for Array Objects
  - Simple interfaces to existing numerical libraries:
    * Linear Algebra (LAPACK)
    * Fourier Transforms (FFTPACK)
    * Random Numbers (RANLIB)

 R is described by its authors as "not unlike" S, which is a language
 developed at Bell Laboratories for statistical computing and graphics.
 It provides support for a variety of statistical and graphical analyses.
 R is a true computer language which contains a number of control-flow
 constructions for iteration and alternation.  It allows users to add
 additional functionality by defining new functions.  Fortran and C
 code can be linked and called at run time.
 .
 S is the statistician's Matlab and R is to S what Octave is to Matlab.

Description: Adds redundancy files to archives for data recovery.
 Ras is a program that adds m extra files to a set of n files, such
 that the contents of the n original files can be regenerated from any
 n of the n+m original files and extra files. Normally, these extra
 files will all be 6 bytes larger then the largest of the original
 files, but ras has a mode in which the extra files are exactly the
 same size as the original files.
 .
 Ras was originally intended for transporting a large file split over
 several floppy disks in a manner resilient to the corruption of a few
 of the disks, and a pair of example shell scripts to do this (rassplit
 and rasmerge) is included in the distribution.

  RScheme can generate byte compiled modules, or compile directly to
  C.  This is quite easy with the current configuration.  See
  /usr/doc/rscheme/module-example for an example.

  The enclosed "rst" executable includes hacks to allow thread
  (instead of process) blocking IO at the expense of readline support.
  rst starts up with a threaded REPL. These hacks should be considered
  highly experimental.

Description: a satellite location program
 Seesat5 uses the NORAD sgp4 algorithm to compute the location of a satellite.
 Many different filtering methods are provided by Seesat5 so that only those
 satellites that might actually be viewed are presented in the report. This
 report includes bearing and elevation with respect to the observer's location
 as well as other information of interest to the observer.
 .
 Although an observer would find no use for it, the program can be made to
 report the location even when it is below the horizon. For radio satellites
 like the Oscar series knowing when it comes above the horizon is some of the
 interesting information this program can provide.

Description: Simple Asynchronous File Transfer
 Sendfile is an asynchronous file transfer service for the Internet,

 another user B without B being active in any way.
 .
 The existing standard file transfer (ftp) is a synchronous service:
 The user must have access to an account on the sending and on the
 receiving site, too.
 .
 Sendfile for Unix, which is an implementation of the SAFT protocol
 (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) now offers you a true
 asynchronous file transfer service for the Internet.  Virtually any
 form of file can be sent, including encrypted ones.  The SAFT
 protocol will be submitted as an RFC in the near future.

Description: Control the behaviour of your cdrom device
 This program allows you to control the behaviour of your Linux cdrom
 player.  You'll need a cdrom device that complies to the new interface
 defined in linux/Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex.  For
 kernel 2.0 this is only the cm206 drive, for kernel 2.1 this
 includes IDE and SCSI drives.
 .
 You can control: auto close, auto eject, medium type checking and
 tray locking.  You can get information on the volume name of cdroms
 and other data, and you can set the speed of your drive and choose a
 disc from a jukebox.
 .
 In order to fully exploit the possibilities, you'll need libc6 and a
 recent version of the the linux kernel, but you will get decent error
 behaviour in return.  Expect a message "No medium found" if you
 attempt to mount an empty drive or "Wrong medium type" if you try to
 mount an audio disc, instead of a whole load of kernel error
 messages.
 .
 The source of this package may be an example for cdrom player program
 developers that wish to exploit the features of the new cdrom
 interface.

Description: create and render 3-d scenes
 This is SIPP, the SImple Polygon Processor, version 3.1.  SIPP is a
 library for creating 3-dimensional scenes and rendering them using a
 scan-line z-buffer algorithm.  A scene is built up of objects which
 can be transformed with rotation, translation and scaling.  The
 objects form hierarchies where each object can have arbitrarily many
 subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a number of connected
 polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud or flat
 shading.  An image can also be rendered as a line drawing of the
 polygon edges without any shading at all.
 .
 The library supports texture mapping with textures in up to
 3-dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture coordinates.
 Simple anti-aliasing can be performed through oversampling.  A scene
 can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources and a
 number of different lightsources are availiable.  The light from some
 of them are capable of casting shadows of objects.  A basic shading
 algorithm is provided with the library, but the user can also use his
 own shading algorithms for each surface to produce special effects.
 Objects can have varying degree of transparency, controlled by the
 shader.

 Design-by-contract means that a class guarantees that certain conditions
 will always hold, and that a routine guarantees certain results
 given certain specified inputs.  The rules for inheritance mean
 that contracts can be relied on even when classes are reused through
 inheritance.

Description: Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (2.0.x and 2.1.x kernels)
 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 Lan Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 Starting with the Debian Samba packages version 2.0.4b-2, the old smbfs
 utilities for 2.0.x and the new smbfs utilities for 2.2.x kernels have been
 merged in a single package called smbfs. A wrapper script called smbmount.sh
 identifies the version of the kernel running and calls the correct binary.

Description: Simple spam-block with refusal message
 Using vix.com's Realtime Blackhole List (RBL) can cause legitimate mail
 to be blocked or bounced. To protect our users, we must bounce it with a
 meaningful message including the reason it was bounced and a local phone
 number.  Because spam often has a bad envelope-from, (and because this
 is more efficient), we must bounce it with an error message during the
 SMTP transaction, rather than send bounce mail later, if the bounce is
 to have much chance of getting back to the sender.
 .
 This SMTP refuser is used along with "tcpd" or another TCP security
 daemon to bounce messages from the IP addresses of known spammers. The
 advantage of this over just blocking the connection is that the remote
 SMTP server will not retry, and a legitimate e-mail sender will get a
 polite message telling them why their mail was blocked and who to call
 to get around the blocking.

 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: Software Upgrade Protocol implementation
 The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon
 University that provide for collections of files to be maintained in
 identical versions across a number of machines.  These programs are:
 .
 SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which
 initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the
 latest  version of a collection of files.  SUP will normally be
 run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to
 upgrade the specified file collections.
 .
 SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the
 system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client
 SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a
 "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously
 and listens for network connection requests by individual client
 processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to
 service that request.
 .
 SUPSCAN: The "file scanner" program, that may optionally be run
 periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It
 pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the
 specifications for a given file collection so that the file server
 need not do this during each upgrade of that collection.  The file
 scanner is normally used daily for very large file collections that
 are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small
 file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client
 machines per day.

Description: Run higher resolution text modes.
 This program is designed to greatly improve the normal
 (EGA-based) textmodes on your Linux machine. It uses an Xconfig-like
 configuration file to set up better looking textmodes. (=higher resolution,
 larger font size, higher display refresh...) This is already a big boon on
 normal 14" displays, and it is an immense difference on larger and better
 (15" and up) screens.
 .
 It stems from the idea that it is a real waste of hardware to use EGA
 textmodes on an SVGA-card, which was designed to do much better than that.
 .
 You will need the `kbd' package if you use screen sizes with a
 character height different from the default.
 .
 WARNING: This program will not work on non-VGA based systems.  Installing it
 will not do any harm, but activating the program can.

 however, also a general purpose programming
 language similar to C but with features derived
 from  Pascal as well as other  interactive
 systems such as Matlab.
 .
 Tela is not a Matlab clone. Many of Tela's
 features are more powerful than in Matlab;
 on the other hand Tela's linear algebra routines are
 not as sophisticated as those in Matlab.

MD5sum: be787f16a2f9ce3ba895a32b7e2cb65c
Description: Compatibility package for old termcap-based programs.
 The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap
 files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based
 programs. Since libc6-based programs are hopefully "modern" enough to be
 linked with ncurses (or slang), this package only provides a libc5-based
 libtermcap library.
 .
 You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs
 since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this
 package if a program (that you cannot recompile) fails to run with
 the error message "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'" or complains
 about a missing /etc/termcap file.
 .
 The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs
 therefore it doesn't provide all the necessary files for compilation. If you
 want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try
 ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses
 instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in
 the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries
 to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.
 .
 This package provides:
  libtermcap.so shared library, version 2.0.8
  termcap database, version 9.13.25

Description: System for processing phonetic symbols in LaTeX
 TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic
 Alphabet) symbols in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for
 either TeX IPA or Tokyo IPA and derived from the tsipa package, made
 in 1992 by Kobayashi Hajime, Fukui Rei and Shirakawa Shun.  Its
 primary distribution site is
 ftp://tooyoo.L.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/TeX/tipa.
 .
 Among many features of TIPA, the following are the new features as
 compared with tsipa or any other existing systems for processing IPA
 symbols:
 .
   * A new 256 character encoding for phonetic symbols (`T3'), which
     includes all the symbols and diacritics found in the recent
     versions of IPA and some non-IPA symbols.
   * Complete support of LaTeX2e.
   * Roman, slanted, bold, bold extended and sans serif font styles.
   * Easy input method in the IPA environment.
   * Extended macros for accents and diacritics.
   * A flexible system of macros for `tone letters'.
   * An optional package (vowel.sty) for drawing vowel diagrams.
   * A slightly modified set of fonts that go well when used with
     Times Roman and Helvetica fonts.

 tm is a MIME package for GNU Emacs.  MIME is a proposed internet
 standard for including content and headers other than (ASCII) plain
 text in messages.
 .
 tm has the following features:
  * MIME style multilingual header (RFC 1522)
  * MIME message viewer (mime/viewer-mode)   (RFC 1521)
  * MIME message composer (mime/editor-mode) (RFC 1521)
  * MIME extenders for mh-e, GNUS, Gnus and RMAIL.
 .
 Note that VM now supports viewing MIME messages by itself, and tm-vm
 cannot be used with newer versions of VM; for this reason it is not
 included any more in the Debian package.
 .
 MIME message viewer and composer also support following features:
  * filename handling by Content-Disposition field (RFC 1806)
  * PGP/MIME security Multiparts (RFC 2015)
  * application/pgp Content-Type (draft-kazu-pgp-mime-00.txt)
  * text/richtext (RFC 1521; obsolete; preview only)
  * text/enriched (RFC 1896)

Description: Cleans up files in directories based on their age
 This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
 directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
 across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
 user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect
 from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the
 process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
 `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
 files unless given a command line option enabling it to.
 .
 WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections
 against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
 functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.

Description: Small yet powerful program for tape oriented backups.
 tob is a simple yet configurable shell-script which, given a set of
 `volume definitions', runs tar or afio based backups, either for use
 with tape drives or floppy disks. You could also mount and unmount
 partitions for backups in the pre- and postcommands. tob is a general
 driver for the making and maintaining of backups.  It makes full
 backups, differential backups (of the files which were changed since
 the last full backup), incremental backups (of files changed since all
 previous backups), lets you determine the size of the backup before
 actually making it, maintain listings of made backups, make remote
 backups and possibly more.

 The LBNL audio tool, vat, is a real-time, multi-party, multimedia
 application for audio conferencing over the Internet. Vat is based on
 the Draft Internet Standard Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
 developed by the IETF Audio/Video Transport working group. RTP is an
 application-level protocol implemented entirely within vat -- you need
 no special system enhancements to run RTP. Although vat can be run
 point-to-point using standard unicast IP addresses, it is primarily
 intended as a multiparty conferencing application. To make use of the
 conferencing capabilities, your system must support IP Multicast, and
 ideally, your network should be connected to the IP Multicast Backbone
 (MBone).
 .
 Vat provides only the audio portion of a multimedia conference; video,
 whiteboard, and session control tools are implemented as separate
 applications. Our video tool is called vic and our whiteboard tool wb,
 UCL developed the session directory tool sdr Other related
 applications include ISI's Multimedia Conference Control, mmcc, the
 Xerox PARC Network Video tool, nv and the INRIA Video-conferencing
 System, ivs.

 VM (View Mail) is an Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read

 more advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating
 digests, message forwarding, and organizing message presentation
 according to various criteria.
 .
 It should also be mentioned here that the documentation for vm is woefully
 behind the times; there fore we include /usr/doc/vm/vm-vars.el.gz, which
 has information about all customizable variables in vm. Also, VM 6.x
 versions have problems with the library tm-vm from the Tiny Mime (TM)
 package, since that version was written for VM 5.X.

Description: Verify electronic mail addresses.
 'vrfy' is a tool to verify email addresses and mailing lists.  In its simplest
 form it takes an address "user@domain", figures out the MX hosts for "domain",
 and issues the SMTP command VRFY at the primary MX host (optionally all), or
 at "domain" itself if no MX hosts exist.  Without "domain" it goes to
 "localhost".  More complex capabilities are: recursively expanding forward
 files or mailing lists, and detecting mail forwarding loops.  Full-blown
 RFC822 address specifications are understood.  Syntax checking can be carried
 out either locally or remotely.  Various options are provided to exploit
 alternative protocol suites if necessary, and to print many forms of verbose
 output.  Obvious limitations exist, but on average it works pretty well.

Description: Yet another window manager. This the next step after AfterStep.
 Written by Alfredo Kojima (http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~kojima) almost from
 scratch, it's better looking and faster than AfterStep, and resembles
 OpenStep more closely. It's also easier to configure than most other window
 managers, and the final goal is to produce a window manager that doesn't
 require editing of configuration files. Window Maker is fast and
 doesn't require tons of memory to run. This release *attempts* to
 upgrade smoothly from 0.14.1-7 (the one in hamm), but the clip icons
 are going to be lost.
 .
 It's not quite finished yet, but it's notheless usable. It lacks a
 pager, but on the other hand it sports an integrated Fiend alike
 application, the Clip. Window Maker doesn't have "virtual desktops" but
 instead of that, it has "WorkSpaces" and "Layers".
 .
 It's suggested that you install Joost Witteveen's menu package, as it
 enhances the usefulness and usability of Window Maker on a Debian
 system greatly. menu will automatically update the desktop menu every
 time an application is added or removed from the system. It can also
 be used to manage other parts of this window manager.
 .
 The wmaker-superfluous and wmaker-traditional packages have
 disappeared because newstyle and superfluous are now start-time
 options.
 .
 This is compiled with --enable-sound. The induced overhead is very
 small and wmaker will work even without a sound card installed. You'll
 need WMSound for this to work.

Description: Window Maker Users' Guide -- postscript format
 This guide describes the use of Window Maker, an X11 window manager.
 Window Maker is the "Next Step after AfterStep".  Written by Alfredo
 Kojima almost from scratch, it's better looking and faster than
 AfterStep, and resembles OpenStep more closely.  It's also easier to
 configure than most other window managers, and the final goal is to
 produce a window manager that doesn't require editing of
 configuration files.  It's also fast and doesn't require tons of
 memory to run.

Description: GTK+ based configuration tool for WindowMaker
 Interactive graphical configuration utility for WindowMaker. It
 offers to configure WindowMaker using a mouse driven point and click
 interface avoiding direct manual editing of its configuration
 files. There's no much point in installing this program without
 WindowMaker on the system, but I guess there are some circumstances
 where that's desirable, for example, self-compiled wmaker versions.

 If you install libwww-perl, this program will be able to grab October
 X's Tile of Day (and optionally install a cronjob to do that on a
 daily basis). If you have no idea who October X is, or what the Tile
 of the Day is, take a few minutes to visit http://themes.org/

 WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation
 toolkit for Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License
 (GPL v2). It is written in ANSI C and Perl 5, build via a GNU Autoconf

 It can be used free of charge both in educational and commercial
 environments.
 .
 WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
 sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
 particular core language. For maximum power WML additionally ships
 with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level
 features build on top of the backends core languages. While not
 trivial and idiot proof WML provides most of the core features real

Description: Secure and efficient http server with advanced features.
 WN is a server for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1).  Its
 primary design goals are security and functionality usually
 available only with complex CGI scripts without the necessity of
 writing or using these scripts.  This includes extensive
 security checks, full text searching and conditionally served
 text.
 .
 Despite this extensive functionality the WN executable is
 substantially smaller than the CERN or NCSA servers.  Both a
 stand-alone daemon and a version intended for use under inetd
 are provided.  The inetd version is designed to minimize the use
 of system resources and it is appropriate for moderate or
 lightly loaded servers which cannot be totally dedicated to Web
 serving.
 .
 WN's security model is based on the use of a small flat database
 in each directory with information about the files in that
 directory.  Fields associated with a file include its title, and
 may include keywords, expiration date and any user defined
 fields like author or document id.  Unlike other servers, the
 default action for WN is to deny access to a file.  A file can
 only be served if explicit permission to do so has been granted
 by entering it in this database.

Description: GTK-based Dictionary Client
 This package provides a graphical frontend to dict, which is a client
 that queries the dictd server.  Since it is TCP based, it can access
 servers on the local host, on a local network, or on the Internet.
 .
 The DICT Development Group maintains several public servers which can
 be accessed from any machine connected to the Internet.  The default
 configuration is to query one of these servers first, but this may be
 changed in the configuration file /etc/dict.conf.
 .
 Queries may be customized by numerous command line options, including
 specifying the database(s) to be queried and the search strategy to
 be used.

 From the author:
 Worklog is a program that helps you keep track of your time.  I wrote
 this program because I have several projects that require me to keep a
 timesheet.  I sometimes spend 5 minutes here and there doing
 miscellaneous administrative tasks.  Rather than invoke an editor on a
 timesheet file for every little segment of my time spent doing these
 tasks, I wanted to leave a clock running and indicate with one or two
 keystrokes the onset or change of any given task.  Worklog is a simple
 ncurses based program to do just that.

Description: Operate X-10 electrical power control modules.
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .
 You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores,
 but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your
 Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order
 one are included in the documentation of this package.

Description: Link two X displays together, simulating a multiheaded display
 x2x joins a pair of X displays together, as if they were a single
 multiheaded display.  The pointer can be warped between displays,
 or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the
 other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also
 moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection
 propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically,
 the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension.
 (The servers shipped by Debian support this.)
 .
 x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use
 a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate
 your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might
 be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the
 displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases,
 and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only
 two at a time.

Description: A concurrent multi-player battle strategy game.
 xbattle is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of
 strategy with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military
 scenarios.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being
 executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they
 all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of
 players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker
 colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can
 be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate
 the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A
 wide variety of command line options (and previously configured game files)
 provide an abundance of different scenarios and gaming environments.

Description: Chinese input server for Crxvt in X11.
 This package contains the XCIN Chinese input server, to be used with
 Chinese Rxvt (provided in the rxvt-ml package) for the X Window System.
 It supports the Big5 character set, the de facto standard for places
 that use traditional Chinese characters, Fantizi.
 .
 Currently, the Debian xcin package defaults to use the 12x24 and
 -dynalab-ming-medium-r-normal-fantizi-24-*-*-*-*-*-big5*-* fonts
 from the xfntbase and xfntbig5p-cmex24m packages.
 .
 If you need the Chinese Postscript HOWTO documents for XCIN,
 please see the xcin-doc package.  (You don't need it unless you
 want to print them.)

Description: Displays an image for each piece of mail in your mailbox.
 XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
 piece of mail in your mail box. This lets you know at a
 glance who you have mail from. XFaces starts out (when you
 have no mail) looking like a color xbiff. As you receive
 mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images. Some of XFaces
 features:
 .
 - Both mono and color images.
 .
 - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.
 .
 - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server
 currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
 SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.
 .
 - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
 show up once on your display. This way, if you receive 30 messages
 from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.
 .
 - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
 images and sounds or ignore that mail message completely. This
 lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
 mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
 left in your system mailbox.
 .
 - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This
 includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
 list.
 .
 - Support for POP mailboxes.
 .
 - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
 contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priority
 item needs your attention.
 .
 - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
 so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
 be used.
 .
 - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
 count, user@host, the contents of any header.

Description: X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure
 xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package.
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlib6g package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the
 concepts of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of
 packages.  A recommended minimal list of packages for such a configuration is:
 xbase, xbase-clients, xf86setup, xfonts-100dpi, xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-base,
 xfonts-scalable, xlib6g, xserver-common, an xserver (several are available,
 and which you use is largely dependent on your graphics hardware), a window
 manager (several are available, and which you use is largely a matter of
 preference), and a terminal emulator X client package (again, several are
 available and which you use is your decision).
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.3".  The version of X used in Debian
 GNU/Linux is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc.,
 and is thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangable in a Debian system.
 .
 Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in
 /usr/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.

 from the X server, and/or have a central repository of fonts on a networked
 machine running xfs so that all the machines running X servers on a network do
 not require their own set of fonts.  xfs may also be invoked by users to, for
 instance, make available X fonts in user accounts that are not available to
 the X server or to an already running system xfs.

Description: replacement for inetd with many enhancements
 This is a replacement for inetd that offers:
     1) access control on all services based on:
        a) address of remote host
        b) time of access
     Access control works on all services, whether multi-threaded or
     single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP protocols.
     All UDP packets can be checked as well as all TCP connections.
     2) Hard reconfiguration:
        a) kills servers for services that are no longer in the
           configuration file
        b) kills servers that no longer meet the access control criteria
     3) Prevents denial-of-access attacks by
        a) placing limits on the number of servers for each service
           (avoids process table overflows)
        b) placing an upper bound on the number of processes it will fork
        c) placing limits on the size of log files it creates
     5) Extensive logging abilities:
        a) for every server started it can log:
          I) the time when the server was started
          II) the remote host address
          III) who was the remote user (if the other end runs a
              RFC-931/RFC-1413 server)
          IV) how long the server was running
              (I, II and III can be logged for failed attempts too).
        b) for some services, if the access control fails, it can
           log information about the attempted access (for example,
           it can log the user name and command for the rsh service)
     and more..

 .
 Tiles may be freely rotated by use of the mouse, flipped (for
 double-sided puzzles) and even shown as shaped windows on the desktop
 (fast machine/video card recommended for the latter!). An example image
 is provided in /usr/lib/games/xjig .

 xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap(1). It opens a window that looks
 like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms and Modifier
 bits that key generates. Clicking on a key simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease
 events on the window of your choice. It is possible to change the KeySyms
 and Modifiers generated by a key through a mouse-based interface. This
 program can also write an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes in
 future sessions.

Description: shared libraries required by libc5 X clients
 The X libraries are the interface between X client programs and the
 hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the
 keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that
 is independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X
 libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.  Xlib itself
 provides the low-level functionality; Xt, the X Toolkit, is often used as a
 foundation for widget libraries such as Lesstif or Athena.  Xaw, the Athena
 widget set, provides a rudimentary set of graphical user-interface elements
 (buttons, scrollbars, text boxes, etc.).  Several more libraries are provided
 to implement the functions of various X extensions.
 .
 Older X programs compiled against libc5 require that the X libraries be
 compiled against libc5 as well.  xlib6 provides such backward compatibility.

 xlock locks the X server till the user enters his/her password at the

 The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen. If
 a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
 password of the user who started xlock. xlockmore extends the standard
 xlock program by adding many more modes that are highly configurable.
 .
 Note that under XFree86, the X11 implementation for Linux, Control-
 Alt-Backspace will defeat the locking mechanism and return your
 console back unless you put "DontZap" in your XF86Config file. 'xdm'
 returns to the login prompt. Control-Alt-F1 (among others) will
 defeat locking mechanism with virtual terminals, so make sure that
 you are not logged onto any virtual consoles.

Description: Graphical Resource Organizer Kit
 xmbase-grok, formerly just called "grok", is a simple database manager
 and UI builder that can -
 .
   *  keep phone and address lists (like a rolodex)
   *  store phone call logs
   *  keep todo lists
   *  manage any other database after simple GUI-driven customization
   *  customized data export, HTML export built in
 .
 More precisely, grok is a program for displaying and editing strings
 arranged in a grid of rows and columns. Each row is presented as a "card"
 consisting of multiple columns, or "fields", that allow data entry. The
 presentation of the data is programmable; a user interface builder that
 allows the user to arrange fields on a card graphically is part of grok.
 Grok also supports a simple language that allows sophisticated queries
 and data retrieval. Grok comes with the above examples and a few others
 as pre-built applications.
 .
 Grok is not a general-purpose database program. It was designed for small
 applications typical for desktop accessories. If you attempt to run your
 major airline reservation system or your space shuttle project with it,
 you are guaranteed to be disappointed.

 The Network Time Protocol allows for the synchronization of clocks on

 systems to participate in this synchronization.

 NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce
 systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of
 synchronizing with even the most precise external time sources.
 .
 The NTP protocol supported by xntpd is defined in RFC's 1059, 1119, and
 1305 for versions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  For more information on how
 NTP works, and how to configure a campus of xntpd daemons, load the optional

Description: X proxy services
 xproxy provides a low bandwidth X proxy (lbxproxy), an X firewall proxy
 (xfwp), and a proxy manager service (proxymngr).
 .
 lbxproxy is useful for running X clients across a slow network connection.
 Applications need not know anything about the Low Bandwidth extension to X
 (LBX); they simply connect to lbxproxy as if it were another server.  The
 proxy accepts client connections, multiplexes them over a single connection to
 the X server, and performs various optimizations on the X protocol to make it
 faster over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections.
 .
 xfwp is an application layer gateway proxy that may be run on a network
 firewall host to forward X traffic across the firewall.
 .
 proxymngr is responsible for resolving requests from xfindproxy (in the
 xbase-clients package) and other similar clients, starting new proxies when
 appropriate, and keeping track of all the available proxy services.

 at buried objects. After you've collected everything, ladders may appear.
 To finish the level you've got to exit through the top of the screen. If
 an enemy falls into a dug brick, he is stunned for a while. If the brick
 fills in with him in it, he is killed, and he will reappear at the top of
 the screen.

 mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
 invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
 now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that

Description: files and utilities common to all X servers
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is
 to communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in
 a standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X Server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such things
 as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many buttons
 the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself know all of
 these things about the input and output devices with which it is interacting.
 The X server must know technical specifications of the graphics hardware and
 monitor, the keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 The X servers in Debian/GNU Linux are authored by the XFree86 Project,
 Inc., who also distribute the rest of the X Window System source code for
 convenience.  XFree86's X servers attempt where possible to take advantage of
 acceleration features present within the video hardware.
 .
 xserver-common contains files required by all XFree86 X servers, and includes
 a text-based program (xf86config) that configures the /etc/X11/XF86Config
 file, whose primary purpose is to describe the computer's video and input
 hardware to the X server.
 .
 All X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know
 of a remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The
 former means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font
 packages may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least
 the xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi, xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages.
 .
 For a more sophisticated (and graphical) X server configuration tool, see
 the xf86setup package (currently for the i386 architecture only).

Description: provides tide and current predictions
 XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide
 variety of formats. Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be generated,
 or a tide clock can be provided on your desktop.
 .
 XTide can work with X-windows, plain text terminals, or the web. This is
 accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive interface
 (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface (tide), and the web
 interface (xttpd).
 .
 The algorithm that XTide uses to predict tides is the one used by the
 National Ocean Service in the U.S. It is significantly more accurate than
 the simple tide clocks that can be bought in novelty stores. However, it
 takes more to predict tides accurately than just a spiffy algorithm -- you
 also need data for every location for which you want
 to predict tides. XTide reads this data from harmonics files that are
 installed with the Debian package.

Description: virtual framebuffer X server
 xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices.  It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing, but
 other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients against
 unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with Xvfb as
 a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the X server
 to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run applications that
 don't really need an X server but insist on having one anyway.

Description: X terminal-emulator similar to xterm, but smaller
 xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less
 compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly
 intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but
 may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory.
 The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use
 of the X toolkit.
 .
 If you are looking for a more featureful terminal-emulator than xvt,
 but one which still uses less swap space than xterm, consider rxvt.
 .
 Features of xterm which xvt does not support include:
 .
  - Tektronix 4014 emulation
  - Session logging
  - Pop-up menus.  The only one of xterm's popup menu commands that
    is provided in xvt is displaying and hiding of the scrollbar
    and this is done simply by pressing any mouse key in the window
    with the CONTROL key held down.
  - Toolkit style configurability.  In particular, xvt does not
    allow the user to remap the mouse or keyboard keys.
 .
 Features which are supported include:
 .
  - VT100 emulation.  Most of the main escape sequences are supported --
    certainly all those used by the standard screen based UNIX
    applications.
  - Lines that scroll off the top of the window are saved and can be
    scrolled back with a scrollbar.
  - Text selection and insertion including double and triple click for
    words and lines.

 that it seems a joke compared to other systems such as gForth or PFE.
 .
 Nevertheless, you could find yForth? nice, in which case you're invited to
 explore yForth?
 .
 It's yours, you can make anything you want with it. If you want an explanation
 of the words provided by yForth? please refer to the draft of ANS Forth or
 something equivalent.  The Net will help you.
 .
 Do not expect the prompt "ok" to come up when you run yForth?, the standard
 says that "ok" shall be printed AFTER every successful command execution...

 Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and tools to

 final document language.  Current converters are for HTML, ms, man, LaTeX
 SGML and texinfo, plus a poor-man's text converter.  Main document types are
 "article", "report", "book" and "manpage".  The Yodl document language is
 designed to be easy to use and extensible.

Description: CGM graphics file browser only
 You can display binary CGMs to X, and write PostScript or CGM output.
 Gist is tuned to work best with Yorick-generated CGMs.  Since CGM is
 not a page description (PostScript is), non-Yorick CGMs may not display
 exactly as intended.  In general, you should avoid CGMs for this reason.
 .
 If you install the yorick package, you get gist as well; this package
 is only for those who want gist but not yorick.

 taken from from other editors:
  * Emacs: General look-n-feel, function names, function behaviors,
    key bindings.
  * XEmacs: Some minor hints for look-n-feel.
  * Jed: Mini help window, mode line.
