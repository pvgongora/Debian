 9wm is an X window manager which attempts to emulate the Plan 9 window
 manager 8-1/2 as far as possible within the constraints imposed by X.
 It provides a simple yet comfortable user interface, without garish
 decorations or title-bars. Or icons.  And it's click-to-type.

description: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
 class, which is part of the libwww-perl package.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation.

 to Debian Linux. "Login accounting" provides summaries of system
 resource usage based on connect time, and "process accounting" provides
 summaries based on the commands executed on the system. In order to use
 `lastcomm' and `sa', you need either a kernel more recent than 1.3.72 as 
 the accounting patches are now included, or an 1.3.x kernel that is 
 patched to support process accounting. 
 'last' is provided by the Debian sysvinit package and not included here.

 provides access to battery status information and may help you to 
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM 
 implementation. APM support has been in the kernel since 1.3.46.
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon that provides logging of the 
 battery status, apm(1), a client that prints /proc/apm, xapm(1x), an
 X11 utility that displays a little graph, (and tailf(1) which follows 
 the growth of a log file). 
 .
 It requires an 1.3.x kernel and should work with both the old 
 (pre-1.3.58) and the new (1.3.58) /proc/apm format. No further 
 changes in the /proc/apm format are anticipated.
 .
 Starting with version 2.4 of apmd, --suspend and --standby are supported
 on kernels 1.3.98 or higher.

description: Binary Editor And Viewer (beav)
 beav is an editor for binary files containing arbitrary
 data.  Text file editors, on the other hand, expect the
 files they edit to contain textual data, and/or to be
 formatted in a certain way (e.g., lines of printable
 characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY.  You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode.  You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes.  Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats.  While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering.   Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file.  The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format.  Files that are bigger than
 memory can be handled.

 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
 .
 features:
  + generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or 
    HTML format
  + handles comments as part of the language grammar
  + automagically documents enum parameter & return

  + handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments

description: The Data Display Debugger, a graphical UI for GDB.
 The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a comfortable graphical
 user interface to the GDB debugger. Besides "usual"
 features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD
 provides a *graphical data display*, where data structures
 are displayed as graphs. A simple mouse click dereferences
 pointers or reveals structure contents. Complex data
 structures can be explored incrementally and interactively,
 using automatic layout if preferred. Each time the program
 stops, the data display reflects the current variable
 values. Using DDD, you can reason about your application by
 viewing its data, not just by viewing it execute lines of
 source code.
 .
 Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written
 in C, C++, Ada, Fortran, Pascal, or Modula-2; machine-level
 debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; GDB/DBX
 command-line interface with full editing, history, and
 completion capabilities; breakpoint, backtrace, and history
 editors; optional program execution in terminal emulator
 window; debugging on remote host; on-line manual;
 interactive help on the OSF/Motif user interface. DDD has
 been designed to compete with well-known commercial
 debuggers.
 .
 This package contains a DDD binary dynamically linked
 against Motif 2.0; it requires that you own a copy of the
 Motif shared libraries.

 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 Dvilj should be used where speed and compact output is needed,

 Another program, efix, converts between fax, text, bit-map and gray-scale 
 formats. fax, a shell script, provides a simple user interface to the efax 
 and efix programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript files as faxes
 and receive, print or preview received faxes. You need ghostscript to fax 
 Postscript. To preview faxes you need a PGM file viewer as xloadimage. 
 .
 Note that you probably have to adapt /etc/efax.rc to your needs.
 .
 This version of efax can be used with the qfax program suite that adds an 
 e-mail-to-fax gateway to efax, a phonebook database system, automated 
 cover page generation, and fax spooling for delayed transmission of faxes.

description: generate "tags" and (optionally) "refs" files
 ctags generates the "tags" and "refs" files from a
 group of C source files.  The "tags" file is used by
 Elvis' ":tag" command, control-] command, and -t option.
 The "refs" file is sometimes used by the ref(1) program.
 .
 Each C source file is scanned for #define statements and
 global function definitions.  The name of the macro or
 function becomes the name of a tag.  For each tag, a line
 is added to the "tags" file.
 .
 The "tags" file is a cross-reference that lists each tag
 name, the name of the source file that contains it, and a
 way to locate a particular line in the source file.
 .
 The "refs" file contains the definitions for each tag in
 the "tags" file, and very little else.  This file can be
 useful, for example, when licensing restrictions prevent
 you from making the source code to the standard C library
 readable by everybody, but you still everybody to know what
 arguments the library functions need.

description: A text editor, patterned after the unix vi editor
 elvisx11-2.0 is patterned after the vi editor, and provides
 a hex mode display, a man page mode display, html processing,

 .
 This is a beta test version, and is expected to have bugs.

 The author says, in his README.hmtl file:
 .
 This software _will_ break.  I know this.  The only reason I'm
 making this version available is so that I can receive bug reports.
 If you aren't willing to suffer core dumps, and report them to me

 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which

 input files for a description of a scanner to generate. The
 description is in the form of pairs of regular expressions
 and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C
 source file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().
 This file is compiled and linked with the -lfl library to
 produce an executable. When the executable is run, it
 analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressios. Whenever it finds one, it executes the
 corresponding C code.

      Crop, color picker, bucket-fill, blend, & text tools 
      Paint tools - (paintbrush, airbrush, clone, blur, sharpen, convolve)

      Numerous effects filters - (blur, edge detect, pixelize, ...) 
      Channel operations - (add, composite, blend, ...) 
 .  
 A good deal of the GIMP's functionality is invested in external
 modules, called plug-ins.  These independent programs are called from
 the GIMP to run as separate processes and carry out essential tasks
 such as loading and saving images, running effects filters, combining
 multiple images with channel operations, and communicating with other
 programs (such as scanning software, ray tracers, other image
 manipulation packages, etc).  Programmers are invited/urged to add
 new functionality by creating new plug-ins.
 .
 GIMP requires Motif. This package is dynamically linked against Motif
 for people who have Motif installed on their system.

      Numerous effects filters - (blur, edge detect, pixelize, ...) 
      Channel operations - (add, composite, blend, ...) 
 .  
 A good deal of the GIMP's functionality is invested in external
 modules, called plug-ins.  These independent programs are called from
 the GIMP to run as separate processes and carry out essential tasks
 such as loading and saving images, running effects filters, combining
 multiple images with channel operations, and communicating with other
 programs (such as scanning software, ray tracers, other image
 manipulation packages, etc).  Programmers are invited/urged to add
 new functionality by creating new plug-ins.
 .
 GIMP requires Motif. This package is statically linked against Motif
 for people who don't have Motif installed on their system.

 .
 The Inter-Language Unification system (ILU) is a multi-language object
 interface system. The object interfaces provided by ILU hide
 implementation distinctions between different languages, between
 different address spaces, and between operating system types. ILU can
 be used to build multi-lingual object-oriented libraries ("class
 libraries") with well-specified language-independent interfaces. It
 can also be used to implement distributed systems. It can also be used
 to define and document interfaces between the modules of
 non-distributed programs. ILU interfaces are specified in ILU's
 Interface Specification Language.

 Now you can play all of the famous Infocom interactive-fiction
 adventure games under Linux.  All that is needed is the machine-independent

 "Lost Treasures of Infocom" (I and II).  Three of Infocom's
 sampler packages (sampler1_R55.z3, sampler2.z3, & minizork.z3)
 are available by anonymous FTP from ftp.gmd.de under the
 /if-archive/infocom/demos directory.  Put them in the local
 directory /usr/lib/games/infocom.

 Two executables are included in this package: one that runs under
 standard termcap ("infocom") and one that uses ansi codes to do color
 ("infocoma").  Both will run on the Linux console.

description: News transport system `InterNetNews' by Rich Salz
 INN is Debian's preferred news transport system.
 .
 The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles
 and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides
 those articles on request to users.  It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites.  Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as `expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn.  The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again.  It also provides the posting interface for the user.

 . 
 It is the latest in a line of development known as "dictionary APL".
 The spelling scheme uses the ASCII alphabet.  The underlying
 concepts, such as arrays, verbs, adverbs, and rank, are extensions
 and generalizations of ideas in APL\360.  Anomalies have been
 removed.  The result is at once simpler and more powerful than
 previous dialects.
 . 
 Why "J"?  It is easy to type.

 Jgraph takes a description of a graph or graphs
 and produces a postscript file on the standard output.  
 .
 Jgraph is ideal for plotting any mixture of scatter point graphs, line
 graphs, and/or bar graphs, and embedding the output into LaTeX, or
 any other text processing system which can read postscript.
 .
 The graph description language is simple enough to get nice looking
 graphs with a minimum of effort, yet powerful enough to give the user
 the flexibility to tailor the appearance of the graph to his or her
 individual preferences.  This includes plotting multiple graphs and
 laying them out separately on the page (or pages).

 libdb is a library for manipulating database files, developed at Berkeley. 
 .
 It supports three kinds of file formats:
  * btree. A representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.
  * hashed. An extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
  * UNIX file oriented. A byte stream file with fixed our variable length 
    records

description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX.
 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing
 commands to control the formatting - and produces a PostScript file
 (though it can also produce formatted plain text output).
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and
 it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout than in
 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

description: An automatic mail-processing tool
 Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has
 far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure
 (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing
 tool, this slices, it dices, it ...
 .
 Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward
 messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post
 the message to a newsgroup.
 .
 It is also possible to process messages containing some commands. 
 .
 You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically
 answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the
 Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to
 be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
 substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into
 your vacation message, for a more personalized reply. 
 .
 You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the
 lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing. 
 .
 The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called
 via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That
 means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You
 also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts.
 .
 It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by
 implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded
 when used.

description: Emacs lisp interface to PGP and anonymous remailers.
 Mailcrypt is an Emacs lisp package that provides a simple but
 powerful interface to cryptographic functions for mail and news.  With
 Mailcrypt, encryption becomes a seamlessly integrated part of your mail
 and news handling environment.  Mailcrypt can automatically fetch 
 public keys to encode, decode, and verify messages, and can be configured 
 to automate mailing through anonymous remailers.
 .
 Although Mailcrypt may be used to process data in arbitrary Emacs
 buffers, it is most useful in conjunction with other Emacs packages for
 handling mail and news.  Mailcrypt has specialized support for Rmail, 
 VM, MH-E, and Gnus.

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.)  Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk.  It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

description: npasswd - a replacement passwd (for better site security)
 npasswd changes or installs a login password for username (your own
 by default).  Only the super-user can change another users' password.
 .
 When changing a password, npasswd prompts for the old password
 and then for the new one.  The new password must be typed twice to
 forestall mistakes.  The new password is checked for reasonableness.
 .
 This is npasswd_boulder + cracklib 5.  I needed it because one of
 my clients had 50% of his Debian users' passwds cracked by crack.
 Some have argued that npasswd + cracklib offers as much (or more)
 security than shadow passwd.  I'm not a security guru, but it's better
 than the default passwd under Debian for multi-user systems.

 Pascal dialects: HP Pascal, Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC
 VAX Pascal, Oregon Software Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's
 Workshop Pascal, Sun/Berkeley Pascal. Modula-2 syntax is
 also supported. Output is a set of .c and .h files
 that comprise an equivalent program in any of several
 dialects of C. Output code may be kept machine and
 dialect-independent, or it may be targeted to a specific
 machine and compiler. Most reasonable Pascal programs are
 converted into fully functional C which will compile and
 run with no further modifications, although p2c sometimes
 chooses to generate readable code at the expense of absolute
 generality.

 at number theorists, but can be used by people whose primary need is
 speed.
 .
 Although quite an amount of symbolic manipulation is possible in PARI,
 this system does very badly compared to much more sophisticated
 systems like Axiom, Macsyma, Magma, Maple, Mathematica or Reduce on
 such manipulations (e.g. multivariate polynomials, formal integration,
 etc...). On the other hand, the two main advantages of the system
 are its speed (which can be between 5 and 100 times better on many
 computations than the above mentioned systems), and the possibility of
 using directly data types which are familiar to mathematicians.

 screen is a terminal multiplexor that runs several separate "screens"
 on a single physical character-based terminal.  Each virtual terminal
 emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions.
 Arbitrary keyboard input translation is also available.  Sessions can
 be detached and resumed later on a different terminal.

 In order to make use of it you must have one or more user level
 mailreader programs such as elm, pine, mailx or Emacs (which has Rmail
 and VM as mailreaders) installed.  If you wish to send messages other
 than just to other users of your system you must also have appropriate

 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

description: TeX - The typesetting system
 TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth as a general typesetting
 engine that reads text together with interspersed commands,
 formats it and outputs a device independent description of
 the formatted pages. The input file is plain ascii, i.e. TeX
 does not feature a WYSIWYG approach to typesetting.
 .
 TeX includes a powerful macro processor allowing the creation
 of higher level packages hiding the TeX primitives from the
 user. The best known and most widely used of these is LaTeX.
 .
 Although designed with a strong emphasis on mathematics (and
 still the formulas generated by TeX are of a quality unsurpassed
 by widely used commercial packages) it's high quality linebreaking
 algorithm, the possibility to use multiple languages, fonts and
 encodings make it useful in many other fields as well.

description: Tinyfugue MUD client for TinyMUDs and LPMUDs
 TinyFugue (also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a line-based
 client designed for connecting to MUD servers (note: LP,
 DIKU, and other servers which use prompts require "/lp
 on"; see /help prompts). TinyFugue runs on UNIX-like systems,
 and on OS/2.
 .
 TinyFugue is larger than most MUD clients, but has many
 more features and is much more flexible. The goal is to
 provide the most functionality in a client that still
 maintains the user-friendliness of Tinytalk. Clients with
 extension languages such as Tcltt or VaporTalk can do a
 little more in certain areas, but are considerably harder
 to use and learn. TF provides most of these abilities in
 such a manner that learning to use any one function is
 relatively easy.

 command. It also uses 'sendmail' commands to do the mail delivery
 work.
 .
  Major Features:
  - listbox interface to messages for easy click and read
  - multiple viewers can be opened on different or the same folder
  - dynamic (at startup) menus for quick access to mail folders
    for reading, copying, and moving messages
  - button bar for quick composing, replying to, and forwarding of
    mail messages
  - built in 'biff' icon for notification of new mail on
    multiple folders
  - easy inclusion of files into message compositions with
    automatic uuencoding and compression, if desired
  - access alternate editor for compositions to send
  - reads aliases from either standard .mailrc or elm aliases.txt
  - easy piping of message text through unix filters
  - emacs-like key-bindings for text editing
  - emacs-like autosave
  - sorting of messages on any field and the ability to

description: Threaded USENET news reader, based on rn
 trn is the most widely-used newsreader on USENET - even to the
 point of being a de-facto standard.
 .
 It has a powerful full screen text mode user interface, where
 most actions are available at the press of a single key.  It is
 highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the
 Network News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server
 available - large sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing
 just local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you
 can configure trn to access it.

 be made via modems, direct (hard-wired) serial connections or via an IP
 connection.  I have not had the opportunity to experiment with that
 latter method.  If someone out there knows how to set it up, please let
 me know.

 ports.  There is still no automatic configuration.

 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .
 You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores,
 but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your
 Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order
 one are included in the documentation of this package.

 linking (and makes this the default). Doesn't have "3dscrollbars",
 see /usr/doc/xaw3d/scrollbars. Doesn't work with aout binaries.

 This package contains the basic X11R6 distribution.  It includes the
 basic clients and configuration files.  It does not include a
 server--servers for several different video cards are included in
 separate packages.  This package also does not include the shared
 libraries--for these, you must install the "xlib" package.  When a
 server and the shared libraries are installed along with this package,
 it provides a functional X Window System installation.  For a more
 complete installation, you can install the "xcontrib" package.

description: A concurrent multi-player battle strategy game
 xbattle is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of
 strategy with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military
 scenarios.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands being
 executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they
 all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of
 players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker
 colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can
 be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate
 the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A
 wide variety of command line options (and previously configured game files)
 provide an abundance of different scenarios and gaming environments.

 It can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and displays the date when a

 it can animate most other fonts that contain all of the digits.  It
 can also do some funky psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use the
 "shape" extension so that the window is shaped like the digits.

 xdvi lets you preview TeX's DVI output under the X11
 windowing sytem. It uses the same pixel files as the intended output
 device. The fonts are scaled down to screen resolution using grey
 scales, resulting in readable screen preview even for rather small fonts.
 .
 xdvi understands postscript \special's supported by dvips and
 knows how to call ghostscript to generate the bitmaps corresponding
 to these \special's and display them together with the rest of the
 page. This mostly eliminates the need for ghostview for previewing
 of TeX documents (xdvi is much faster).

 xlock locks the X server till the user enters his/her password at the

 The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen. If 
 a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
 password of the user who started xlock.

 Note that under XFree86, the X11 implementation for Linux, Control-
 Alt-Backspace will defeat the locking mechanism and return your 
 console back unless you put "DontZap" in your XF86Config file. 'xdm'
 returns to the login prompt. Control-Alt-F1 (among others) will 
 defeat locking mechanism with virtual terminals, so make sure that

 time-of-day in agreement with Internet standard time
 servers. xntp is a complete implementation of the Network
 Time Protocol (NTP) version 3 standard, as defined by
 RFC 1305, but also retains compatibility with version 1
 and 2 servers as defined by RFC 1059 and RFC 1119, respectively
 xntp does all computations in fixed point arithmetic and
 requires no floating point code. The computations done
 done in the protocol and clock adjustment code are
 carried out with high precision and with attention to the
 details which might introduce systematic bias into the
 computations, to try to maintain an accuracy suitable for
 synchronizing with even the most precise external time
 source.

 completely idle while the display is locked and you don't type at it,
 and it doesn't do funny things to the X access control lists.
