Description: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions

 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.

 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages
 are executed each day.

     (and so can be read on any browser).
   * It understands the common log format as well as the NCSA old-style
     format and the NCSA/Apache referer log, agent log, error log and
     combined log. Uncompresses them on the fly if necessary.
   * It can be run at the command line or from a web form interface.

Description: Arbitrary precision calculator (original name: calc)
 Calc is an arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like
 language. Calc is useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyper and as a
 mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides one with a
 machine independent means of computation. Calc comes with a rich set of
 builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.
 .
 Calc is built on top of the library libcalc that represents numeric values
 as fractions reduced to their lowest terms. This library can also be used
 to add arbitrary precision capabilities to your own programs and is
 available in the Debian package `apcalc-dev'.
 .
 The original name of this package is `calc', but it had to be changed to
 `apcalc' for Debian, because there's already another package called `calc'
 in Debian. Nevertheless, the binary and manpage installed by this package
 are still named `calc'.

 implementation. APM support has been in the kernel since 1.3.46.
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon that provides logging of the
 battery status, apm(1), a client that prints /proc/apm, xapm(1x), an
 X11 utility that displays a little graph, (and tailf(1) which follows
 the growth of a log file).
 .
 You need to enable APM support for your kernel during configuration; the
 corresponding questions are in the 'Character devices' section.

Description: Apple ][ Emulator
 This is a fully-functional 100% Apple ][ emulator for the Linux console.
 .
 It is partly written in 386 (AT&T) assembler and partly in C. You can
 switch diskettes using a diskette database through an intuitive
 interface.  Furthermore, it is possible to trim the speed of the
 emulator and it runs in full speed (approximately) twice as fast as an
 standard Apple II+ on a 486DX-50.  It uses the svgalib's key scancodes
 and implements the undocumented 6502 instructions (required by at
 least two games: Bug Attack and MS Pacman).
 .
 Because the Apple ROMs are copyrighted, they are not included here.  You
 will have to make copies of them from your old Apple computer.  If you
 don't want to mess around with this, you can find a copy at:
 .
    http://geta.life.uiuc.edu/~badger/files/apple_II.rom
    http://geta.life.uiuc.edu/~badger/files/slot6.rom
 .
 Transferring your old Apple disks is a bit of work, but you can save
 yourself the trouble of digging up your old masters by seeing if some
 kind soul has already done the work for you at:
 .
    ftp://ftp.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/
 .
 Remember, you can only use these roms and images _legally_ if you already
 own the original.  Have fun!   (Ahhh....  What memories!)

 is at a premium. "Bash", however, has some nice features absent from
 "ash", and "bash" is a required part of the system, so there isn't much

 AUC TeX also lets you browse through compiling errors TeX reports,
 while it moves the cursor directly to the reported error and displays
 documentation for that particular error.  This will even work when the
 document is spread over several files.
 .
 Currently XEmacs ships with its own AUC TeX, so this package should only

Description: Linux AWE32 driver source and utilities
 Linux can now support the Sound Blaster 32, and Sound Blaster AWE32, through
 the use of a driver written by Takashi Iwai <iwai@dragon.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>.
 These utilities are the package of AWE32 utilities for use with this driver,
 which manipulate patch files. They are required to load the vital '.SBK', or
 '.SF2' files, which will have been installed with your AWE32 DOS or Win95
 software in \SB16\SFBANK or \Windows\System. This also includes 'gusload',
 for loading GUS-format patches to the AWE32 driver.
 .
 This package installs the source for the AWE32 driver into /usr/src/awedrv.
 In order to use the awe32 driver, you must recompile your kernel, after using
 the install script found in this package to patch these sources into your
 kernel source tree (they can alternatively be manually installed into the
 kernel source or into a separate copy of the sound driver).
 .
 There are also some converters between different patch file formats for the
 AWE32, and the 'sfxtest' program for testing the AWE32 driver, which are
 installed in /usr/lib/awe.

 characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY. You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode. You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes. Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats. While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering. Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file. The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format. Files that are bigger than
 memory can be handled.

 Browser-history came from the will to overcome a Netscape bug: there
 is no global history, and if you close a window, its whole history is
 lost. For people browsing lots of sites, having the possibility of
 backtracking to where one has been before means that you dont have to
 put everything in your bookmarks file. If you are not sure if a site
 may be worth remembering, don't add it in your bookmarks. If you need
 it later, just browse your history files.
 .
 It works with: Netscape Navigator, Mozilla, and Arena.  Support for
 `browser-history' can easily be added to other browsers, provided you
 can program and have the browser sources.
 .
 A manual page and simple documentation will be installed in
 "/usr/doc/browser-history/browser- history.html", along with a simple
 CGI interface to grep the history log and display the result.  The
 optional CGI program requires `cgiwrap' or Apache configured with
 `suexec'.

Description: Speed up delivery of e-mail to large numbers of recipients.
 This is a C program to do "bulk" mailing.  For input, it takes a file
 of recipient addresses (one address per line) and a message (with
 headers already attached) to be sent to the recipients.  It sorts the
 recipient list by reversed domain (so similar ones sort together),
 splits up the recipients into several groups containing no more than N
 domains each, creates an SMTP envelope for each group of recipients,
 and feeds that envelope to "/usr/lib/sendmail -bs".
 .
 Smartlist also contains a bulkmail-style tool.

Description: a high-quality block-sorting file compressor
 bzip2 is a freely available (GNU GPL'd), patent free, high-quality data
 compressor.  It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best
 available techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and
 six times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based
 compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of
 statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).  If you need to extract old *.bz files,
 please also install the Debian package "bzip".

Description: Graham Stoney's mechanized man page generator
 C2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments from C
 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
 .
 Features:
  * generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or
    HTML format
  * handles comments as part of the language grammar
  * automagically documents enum parameter & return
    values
  * handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
 Problems:
  * doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)

     * free called with address not obtained from malloc
     * free an already freed block

Description: Debian package scripts for CVS source trees.
 This package provides the capability to inject or import Debian
 source packages into a CVS repository, build a Debian package from
 the CVS repository, and helps in integrating upstream changes into
 the repository.
 .
 The import or inject process takes a dsc (Debian source control)
 file, and imports it into CVS. The module path can maintains
 distribution and section information; for example, one may inject
 hemm/hemm/devel/make into the repository.
 .
 The build process works analogously to dpkg-buildpackage, and can be
 used from within the checked out source tree, or with additional
 information, can be used from anywhere. In the latter case, you can
 build any previous version of the package, as long as the
 corresponding orig.tar.gz file is still around. The build script
 checks out the relevant version from the CVS repository, and runs
 dpkg-buildpackage to create the Debian package.
 .
 Combined, these utilities provide an infrastructure to facilitate the
 use of CVS by Debian maintainers. This allows one to keep separate
 CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and possibly
 experimental distributions, along with the other benefits of a
 version control system.
 .
 This can be used to generate a unified CVS source tree, for example.

 CWEB allows you to write documents which can be used simultaneously as

 The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the best
 possible documentation for their programs need two things simultaneously: a
 language like TeX for formatting, and a language like C for programming.
 Neither type of language can provide the best documentation by itself.  But
 when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system that is much more
 useful than either language separately.

 single sequential set of disk blocks, and all the free space on the
 disk is collected together in a single region.  This generally means
 that reading a whole file is more efficient.

Description: Alternative Debian package manager
 dftp is another program to maintain your Debian installation. It
 downloads the lists of currently available packages via FTP, compares
 them to the installed packages and lets you interactively select
 which new/upgraded packages you want to install. Dependencies of new
 packages are checked and missing packages offered for installing,
 too. Then all selected packages are fetched with FTP and verified for
 correctness. Installation of packages is done via dpkg, and ordered
 by dependencies.
 .
 dftp's main advantage over other interfaces to Debian package
 management is that it can (partially) run on a different machine than
 the target system, if that doesn't have direct FTP access. Scanning
 the current installation and installing packages must of course be
 done on the target system. But package selection and download can be
 moved to a different machine. dftp can also run on non-Debian
 systems. Therefore it is also available as a standalone version (Perl
 script) in /debian/project/misc.

Description: dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP.
 Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone
 lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off.
 diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are
 Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link
 down when it is idle.
 .
 diald operates by starting a SLIP link on a pseudo tty and setting up
 a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the
 proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real
 communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from
 the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it
 needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly
 diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling
 these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup
 files.
 .
 For diald to work the kernel *must* have SLIP devices, either compiled in
 or as a module, even if only PPP connections are made. In the latter case
 you should also have pppd, of course.
 .
 Diald needs a program like "chat" or "expect" to actually dial.
 Sorry, "dip" cannot be used.

 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 required, rather than the time-consuming recursive directory scan, as well as
 logging of all dpkg actions in the install method.

Description: The headers and static libraries for ext2fs-aware tools-development.
 EXT2FS stands for "Extended Filesystem", version 2. It's the filesystem
 type used for hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and shared libraries needed to compile
 ext2fs-aware programs. Only programmers that really manipulate
 features specific to the ext2 filesystem will need this. Most
 programmers will use the generic filesystem-independent interface
 from libc.
 .
 It also contains dev files for 2 other libs (e2p and uuid) used by
 the e2fsprogs, but which are not yet packaged all by themselves
 because they lack documentation. They may also lack some support
 files, by I can't really know until someone uses them...
 .
 libe2p is for user-level e2fsprogs commands.  It's used by dumpe2fs,
 chattr, and lsattr.  Functions in libe2p typically have two
 characteristics (a) don't require that block device containing the
 filesystem be opened directly (functions in libext2fs do), and (b)
 libe2p typically contains printf statements or parse user input, and so
 have more internationalization issues.
 .
 libuuid generates and parses 128-bit universally unique id's (UUID's),
 using a standard which is blessed by both Microsoft and DCE, and is
 being proposed as an internet standard.  See the internet-draft:

 for C++ programs:  a collection of useful routines which don't have to
 be reinvented each time a new program is written.
 .
 Elib contains code for:
  - container data structures (queues, stacks, AVL trees, etc)
  - string handling functions missing in standard emacs
  - minibuffer handling functions missing in standard emacs
  - routines for handling lists of so called cookies in a buffer.

Description: MIME & PGP-aware interactive mail reader [enhanced]
 Elm ME+ is an enhanced version of the Elm mail reader.
 Features you will find in Elm ME+ include: anonymous
 remailer support, chaining, PGP, MIME, MIME type guessing,
 message/rfc822 enhanced support, application/pgp support,
 fully configurable from within the program, delivery status
 notification (in compliance with ESMTP), and more.
 .
 PGP features include: mark on folder menu showing PGP
 encrypted messages and public key blocks, encryption and
 signing of outgoing messages, decryption, signature checking,
 mailing public key blocks, extracting public key blocks
 from messages.  Special feature allows you to have Elm ME+
 keep track of your PGP passphrase so you only need to enter
 it a minimal number of times.
 .
 MIME features include: internal handling of MIME encodings
 and multipart/* messages -- only needs to use metamail
 with a content-type that Elm doesn't understand, access
 to individual portions of MIME multipart message via
 a special menu, "[include" construct when editing message
 as well as a new easy-to-use "Attachments" menu that lets
 you add/modify/delete attachments, mime.types support.
 .
 Elm's interface is interactive, full-screen.  All configuration
 can be done within the program -- no need to edit external files.
 .
 This version of Elm ME+ is officially designated
 "Elm2.4ME+ PL37 (25)" meaning this enhanced version of
 Elm is based upon Elm2.4pl25.  Thus is has all features
 present in Elm2.4pl25 plus its enhanced feature set.

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.  (Until now, the only
 option available to visually impaired users has been to use a talking
 PC as a terminal.)  Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once you
 start emacs with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
 everything you do.  Your mileage will vary depending on how well you
 can use Emacs.  There is nothing that you cannot do inside Emacs :-).
 This package includes speech servers written in tcl to support the
 DECtalk Express and DECtalk MultiVoice speech synthesizers.  For
 other synthesizers, look for separate speech server packages.

 EPIC was originally built upon the ircII-2.6 client and has maintained
 faithfulness to remain current up to the 2.8.2 release.
 EPIC is somewhat larger than the stock client (24%), but that is mostly
 because of the multitude of new features, the dual ANSI/K&R compliant
 function headers, and the large amount of re-written code in an attempt
 to make ircii faster, more efficient, and more powerful.

Description: Circumventing Debian package dependencies
 This is a dummy package that makes Debian's package management
 system believe that equivalents to packages on which other
 packages do depend on are actually installed.
 .
 Deinstallation of this package is only possible when all pending
 dependency issues are properly resolved in some other way. A more
 brutal approach for it's deinstallation is to create and install
 'equivs' configured using an empty "/etc/equivs.conf" (or simply
 delete it) to remove all of the existing dependencies with any
 installed package on the system.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used
 might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

Description: The reincarnation of the classic ctags(1).
 This is a reimplementation of the underused ctags(1) program and is intended
 to be the mother of all ctags programs 8^). I was motivated to write this
 because no currently available ctags program supported generation of tags for
 all possible tag candidates, and because most were easily fooled by a number
 of contructs. I am quite pleased with the result. It provides the following
 features:
 .
     Able to generate tags for all of the following objects:
 	- macro definitions
 	- enumeration values (those inside enum{...})
 	- function definitions (and some C++ methods)
 	- function prototypes (optional; intended for library header files)
 	- enum, struct and union tags and C++ class names
 	- typedefs
 	- global variables
 .
     Supports for both K&R style and new ANSI style function definitions.
 .
     It is very robust in parsing C code and is extremely hard to fool, even
     with conditional preprocessor contructs.

 .
 Currently this is more stable than g77, and is the recommended way
 to compile Fortran as black box routines.  However source level

 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

Description: The FREE TrueType Font Engine, shared library files.
 This package contains the runtime shared library and documentation files
 for FreeType, the FREE TrueType Font Engine.
 .
 The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
 engine, available in ANSI C and Pascal source code.  It has been
 developed to provide TT support to a great variety of platforms and
 environments.
 .
 Notice that FreeType is a *library*.  It is *not* a font server for
 your preferred environment, even though it has been designed to be the
 basis of many high-level libraries, tools and font servers.
 .
 It's a clean-room implementation that is not derived from the original
 TT engine developed by Apple and Microsoft, though it matches it
 regarding rendering quality.  To our knowledge, it's the only
 royalty-free complete TrueType engine available.
 .

  Note: This is *not* an X11 TrueType font server.  See the `xfstt'
        Debian package instead.

Description: An alternative to anonymous FTP
 In the words of the developers, FSP is what anonymous FTP should have
 been. Basically, FSP is more robust (an intermittent link doesn't faze
 it one bit) and kinder to slow links (the data transfer rate is
 significantly lower) than FTP; this enables a given server to handle
 requests from many more clients than a corresponding FTP server.
 Furthermore, the FSP clients are all run from the command line, storing
 certain information - such as the current directory - in the environment.
 As a consequence, whilst you are downloading a file, you can also be
 browsing other directories of interest.
 .
 From the clients' point of view, FSP allows the access restrictions to be
 lifted, because of the slower transfer rate. (How many times have you had
 "User anonymous access denied" flash at you?) From the servers' point of
 view, much less strain is placed on the network, and because the server
 never forks, the maximum increase in load is one.
 .
 If you want to learn more about FSP, the FSP FAQ is included in
 /usr/doc/fsp; it can also be accessed from the Web address
 http://itu.rdg.ac.uk/misc/fsp/faq/faq.htm
 .
 Two popular FSP sites are ftp.wustl.edu, port 21, and
 fsp.idsoftware.com, also on port 21. Both of these are identical to their
 corresponding FTP sites.

Description: A semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs.
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

 holiday list, Gcal offers the facility to display fixed dates on the
 day of their occurrence and to remind or inform the user about them.
 So it's imaginable after booting the computer or starting the work

 mail, about all holidays or appointments which are observed or

 suite that can be configured to work with most UPSs featuring an RS232
 monitoring port.
 .
 Depending on the UPS, cable, and the manner in which the genpower
 package is configured, the genpower package provides the following
 features:
 .
  * Line power sensing
  * Low battery detection
  * Physical cable detection
  * The ability to kill the UPS's inverter
 .
 The Debian package has an extra cable description called "apc-pnp"
 that should support all of the above for the APC Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS,
 and Matrix-UPS systems using the included Windows-95 Plug-and-Play cable!

 pre-defined words, and programming in Forth consists of defining and
 executing new words that are combinations of previously defined words.  It
 has been said that learning Forth changes forever the way you think about
 writing programs.

 Not to be confused with gnats, the bug tracking system.
 .
 This version is based on patching the FSF gcc-2.7.2.3 sources with
 the gnat-3.10p source patches, and building it with a previous binary
 distribution.  Tools have been modified to use "gnatgcc" as the driver
 and libgnatgcc instead of libgcc as the support library.
 .
 Due to problems caused by diversions in previous versions, this release
 no longer "diverts" gcc, but installs "gnatgcc" as the gnat compiler.

Description: A generic audio mixer (Base versions)
 gom is a generic audio mixer program; it tries to provide a complete

 gom's facilities include sound driver (compile time) and sound card
 (run time) independence, arbitrary mixer selection, loading and saving
 of mixer settings, volume fading, verbosity-level driven output,
 "Un*x-like scripting support", etc.
 .
 At the moment, gom only supports the Open Sound System (OSS) sound
 driver. OSS comes with the Linux kernel as free software called
 OSS/Free, and is available for a number of other platforms.
 .
 Apart from the exhaustive command line interface described here, gom
 optionally has two built-in interactive interfaces (that I call
 gomiis, gom interactive interfaces;): a terminal gomii using ncurses,
 and a X gomii using the xview toolkit.  All gomiis support adjustable

 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about

 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: A PostScript and PDF viewer for X using 3d Athena Widgets
 `gv' is a comfortable viewer of PostScript and PDF files for the X
 Window System.
 .
 From version 3.0 on `gv' cannot be used with the standard Athena
 Widget library.  Nevertheless you do not have to use the 3d Widgets
 for anything else as this version is compiled using `-rpath
 /usr/X11R6/lib/Xaw3d'.
 .
 It uses the `gs' PostScript(tm) interpreter and is based on the
 classic X front-end for `gs', `ghostview'. It is more comfortable and
 more powerful than `ghostview'.
 .
 Some features as e.g. PDF files or anti-aliasing are only supported
 if a recent Aladdin ghostscript (4.0 or later) is installed.  With
 anti-aliasing turned on, the text is very crisp and readable, with no
 `stepping' on the slants at all.  For this reason, the `gs-aladdin'
 package, to be found in `non-free' due to Aladdin's licencing, is
 highly recommended.
 .
 The new `gs-aladdin', version (>= 4.0), can view PDF files.  It is
 mostly compliant with Adobe's PDF format, so it has less problems
 than `xpdf'. There is no support for encrypted pdf files.  It
 provides much better output than `xpdf' and even `AcroRead' (Adobe's
 PDF Reader) but is slower and does not yet support hyperlinks.

 The GWM (Generic Window Manager) is an extensible Window Manager for
 the X Window System Version 11. It is based upon a WOOL (Window
 Object Oriented Language) kernel, which is an interpreted dialect of
 Lisp with specific window management primitives. GWM should be able
 to emulate efficiently other window managers, and play the same role
 for window managers as EMACS does for text editors.

 ht://Dig can span several web servers at a site. The type of these different
 web servers doesn't matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1.0
 protocol.

 from your input. You can use all of LaTeX's power for the printed
 output, and you don't have to learn a new language for creating
 hypertext documents.
 .
 Note that Hyperlatex is not meant to translate arbitrary Latex files
 into HTML. Rather, it provides an authoring environment for writing
 printed documents and HTML documents at the same time, using an
 extended subset of Latex (excluding concepts that have no HTML
 counterpart and adding commands for new HTML concepts such as
 hyperlinks or included images).

 pdfTeX.
 .
 Included are:
 .
  a) (backref) a package by David Carlisle to provide links back from
     bibliography to the main text; these are hypertext links after
     using hyperref.
  b) (nameref) a package to allow reference to the *names* of sections
     rather than their numbers.
 .
 xr.sty: This is a modified version of the xr package from the Standard
 LaTeX tools distribution. It has some internal changes to cooperate
 with the hyperref package, and one new user level argument, also
 mainly of use for hyperref.
 If no problems are reported the version in the tools distribution
 will be updated to match this at the next LaTeX release.

Description: Libraries for Icon, a high-level programming language
 Ideal for both complex nonnumerical applications and for situations where
 users need quick solutions with a minimum of programming effort, Icon is a
 high-level, general purpose programming language with a syntax similar to
 Pascal and C. Its applications include: rapid prototyping, analyzing
 natural languages, generating computer programs, and artifical
 intelligence. (From the back cover of the book "The Icon Programming
 Language," by Griswold and Griswold.)
 .
 This package contains the Icon program library, a library of Icon
 procedures and programs contributed by Icon users.

Description: Compiler for Icon, a high-level programming language
 Ideal for both complex nonnumerical applications and for situations where
 users need quick solutions with a minimum of programming effort, Icon is a

 Pascal and C. Its applications include: rapid prototyping, analyzing
 natural languages, generating computer programs, and artifical

 Language," by Griswold and Griswold.)
 .
 This package contains the Icon compiler. It generates programs that
 generally run faster than those of the icont/iconx Icon interpreter. On the
 other hand, the Icon compiler takes much longer to compile programs and is
 more memory-hungry than the iconx/icont pair. As such, the compiler is
 probably only useful to speed up the execution of large Icon programs once
 they are fully developed and debugged.

Description: The Inter-Language Unification system
 The Inter-Language Unification system (ILU) is a multi-language object
 interface system. The object interfaces provided by ILU hide
 implementation distinctions between different languages, between
 different address spaces, and between operating system types. ILU can
 be used to build multi-lingual object-oriented libraries ("class
 libraries") with well-specified language-independent interfaces. It
 can also be used to implement distributed systems. It can also be used
 to define and document interfaces between the modules of
 non-distributed programs. ILU interfaces are specified in ILU's
 Interface Specification Language.

 WARNING: If you're installing this package for the first time and you
 choose to use libmagick4g-lzw, install first with libmagick4g, and then
 select libmagick4g-lzw (which will deselect libmagick4g). Otherwise you
 won't be able to install with dselect.
 .
 Imagemagick is a set of programs to manipulate various image formats
 (JPEG, TIFF, PhotoCD, PBM, XPM, etc...). All manipulations can
 be achieved through shell commands as well as through a X11 graphical
 interface (display).
 .
 Possible effects: colormap manipulation, channel operations, thumbnail
 creation, image annotation, limited drawing, image distortion, etc...
 .
 Imagemagick requires the libmagick4g package to be installed. Libmagick
 comes in two flavors, a free version (without the LZW compression algorithm
 used in GIFs), and a non-free version (with the patented LZW compression
 algorithm).
 .
 This package suggests a postscript interpreter (gs) to read postscript
 files. It will however function happily without it (as long as you don't
 want to read postscript).

Description: remote mail folder access server for Pine and others
 IMAP (the Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is a mechanism for
 accessing mail folders and the messages in them remotely, ie with
 your user mail program running on a different machine to the one
 where all the messages are stored.
 .
 This protocol for remote mail access is supported by Pine and by some
 DOS/Windows and Macintosh MUA's (Mail User Agents).
 .
 If you just want to use Pine to read your email on your Linux system
 you do not need this package.
 .
 If you do install imapd you will almost certainly want to install a
 Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail
 programs which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will
 usually want to send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.
 .
 You will probably also want to install Pine or some other IMAP client
 so that you can test your IMAP server.

 order to have each one's dimensions available so the next can be placed.

Description: News transport system `InterNetNews' by the ISC and Rich Salz
 INN is Debian's preferred news transport system.
 .
 The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles
 and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides
 those articles on request to users.  It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites.  Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as `expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn.  The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again.  It also provides the posting interface for the user.

 radio interconnection of network 44.  Also, because the daemon is outside the
 kernel, it provides an excellant environment for experimenting with alternate
 mechanisms for distributing encapsulation routing updates.
 .
 If you need one encapsulation link, use the kernel's built-in support.  If
 you need a lot of encapsulation links, give this daemon a try.

Description: Jim Plank's program for producing PostScript graphs
 Jgraph takes a description of a graph or graphs
 and produces a postscript file on the standard output.
 .
 Jgraph is ideal for plotting any mixture of scatter point graphs, line
 graphs, and/or bar graphs, and embedding the output into LaTeX, or
 any other text processing system which can read postscript.
 .
 The graph description language is simple enough to get nice looking
 graphs with a minimum of effort, yet powerful enough to give the user
 the flexibility to tailor the appearance of the graph to his or her
 individual preferences.  This includes plotting multiple graphs and
 laying them out separately on the page (or pages).

 jless is a program similar to  more(1),  but  which  allows
 backward  movement  in the file as well as forward movement.
 Also, jless does not have  to  read  the  entire  input  file
 before starting, so with large input files it starts up fas-
 ter than text editors like vi(1).  jless  uses  termcap  (or
 terminfo  on  some  systems),  so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.
 .
 jless supported ISO 2022 code extension techniques and
 Japanese codes.

Description: a server for an online multiuser virtual world
 Lambdamoo is a server for a virtual world, a computer program which users
 can log into and explore. Each user takes control of a computerized
 persona/avatar/incarnation/character. You can walk around, chat with other
 people, solve puzzles, and even create your very own rooms, descriptions
 and items.
 .
 Advanced users can program Lambdamoo, via its built in object-oriented
 programming language.
 .
 Lambdamoo only provides the bare framework for your virtual world. A
 lambdamoo guru could theoretically start with lambdamoo and the included
 minimal core database and work their way up to a full-fledged system. The
 rest of us will want to install the lambdacore or jhcore packages which
 add objects and functionality to lambdamoo.

 Less is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward
 movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not
 have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
 files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1).  Less uses
 termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.

 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as posible by using several connections at the same time.

Description: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
 class, which is part of the libwww-perl package. This is the
 replacement for the now obsolete CGI-modules package.
 .
 This package is destined to replace libcgi-pm-perl, but at the moment
 libcgi-pm-perl (as in the library CGI.pm) serves as the rapid
 prototyping version, and may be more featureful than this package.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation.

Description: GNU dbm database routines (runtime version). [libc5 compat]
 Only install this package if you have libc5 programs that still need it.
 GNU dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible
 hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.
 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).

Description: User binaries for a GSM speech compressor.
 Contains user binaries for libgsm, an implementation of the European
 GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding,
 prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long
 term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 several tools that require this functionality, we've created this
 system-independent API to ease in porting and to alleviate the need
 for several system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.

Description: C headers, static libraries and documentation for libPropList
 The library uses an opaque data type to represent a tree structure
 made of strings, data blocks, arrays and dictionaries (key-value pair
 lists). This structure can be manipulated, written out to and read in
 from a file, and synchronized with the contents of a file.  The
 purpose of PL is to closely mimic the behavior of the property lists
 used in GNUstep/OPENSTEP (there formed with the NSString, NSData,
 NSArray and NSDictionary classes) and to be compatible with it. PL
 enables programs that use configuration or preference files to make
 these compatible with GNUstep/OPENSTEP's user defaults handling
 mechanism, without needing to use Objective-C or GNUstep/OPENSTEP
 themselves.

Description: SID (MOS 6581) emulation library
 This is a (shared) library that implements the emulation of the C64's
 SID chip (MOS 6581) and CPU (6510). It is used by several "player"
 applications, e.g. sidplay, which make it possible to listen to really
 a lot (7300+) of tunes, known from old and new C64 programs (as well
 as Amiga compositions).
 Find most of the available musics from your favourite games or demos
 and more in the High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC). For downloads and
 information about the volunteers, who maintain the collection, look at

 what's returned.  Thus it provides a way to interactively type messages
 and see the results, all inside the rich structure of the Tcl scripting
 language--almost an Objective-C interpreter.  The library also provides
 an Objective-C object that will forward all of its messages to the Tcl
 interpreter in textual format.

Description: Build & maintain a city/country
 You are required to build and maintain a city. You must feed, house,
 provide jobs and goods for your residents. You can build a sustainable
 economy with the help of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for
 broke and build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource
 starved planet, it's up to you. Due to the finite resources available in any
 one place, this is not a game that you can leave for long periods of time.
 This game is similar to the commercial simulation game with a similar

Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX.
 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing
 commands to control the formatting - and produces a PostScript file
 (though it can also produce formatted plain text output).
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and
 it is much easier to understand how to do things in Lout than in
 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

Description: An automatic mail-processing tool
 Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has
 far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure
 (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing
 tool, this slices, it dices, it ...
 .
 Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward
 messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post
 the message to a newsgroup.
 .
 It is also possible to process messages containing some commands.
 .
 You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically
 answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the
 Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to
 be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
 substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into
 your vacation message, for a more personalized reply.
 .
 You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the
 lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing.
 .
 The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called
 via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That
 means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You
 also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts.
 .
 It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by
 implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded
 when used.

 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 meaning into what is said than is actually there; we are fooled into reading
 structure into chaos, and we interpret non-sequitur as valid conversation.

 MegaHAL differs from conversation simulators such as Eliza in that it uses
 a Markov Model to learn how to hold a conversation. It is possible to
 teach MegaHAL to talk about new topics, and in different languages.

 This is the MH mail user agent (reader/sender), a command line

 excellent choice for people who receive and process a lot of mail.
 .
 Unlike most mail user agents, MH is not a single program, rather it
 is a set of program that are run from the shell.  This allows the user
 to utilize the full power of the Unix shell in coordination with MH.
 Various front-ends are available, such as mh-e (an emacs mode), xmh,
 and exmh (X11 clients).
 .
 WARNING: This package is not being actively maintained upstream.  It
 has known limitations dealing with MIME and other modern mail
 features.  The nmh package will probably eventually replace the Rand MH,
 although at this point, mh is still standard.

 This program performs the decoding of transfer encoded text type
 mime messages.  The message in its entirety is read from stdin.
 The decoded message is written to stdout; hence, this program
 behaves as a filter which may be placed wherever convenient.
 .
 It is assumed that the message has reached its point of final
 delivery and at that point 8-bit text types can be handled
 natively.  Hence, the need for transfer-encodings is not present
 any more.
 .
 Only some cases are handled:
  - encoded header fields are decoded from QP or B encoding.
  - The charset is assumed to be iso-8859-1
  - part or subparts of content-type text only are decoded
  - all other content-types are passed transparently.

 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.

Description: An interface for scientific data access.
 NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for scientific
 data access and a freely-distributed software library that provides an
 implementation of the interface.  The netCDF library also defines a
 machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
 Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
 access, and sharing of scientific data.

Description: Text-based/X11 overhead view D&D-style adventure game
 Nethack is a wonderfully silly, yet quite addicting, Dungeons and
 Dragons-style adventure game. You play the part of a fierce fighter,
 wizard, or any of many other classes, fighting your way down to
 retrieve the Amulet of Yendor (try saying THAT one backwards!) for
 your god. On the way, you might encounter a quantum mechanic or two,
 or perhaps a microscopic space fleet, or -- if you're REALLY lucky --
 the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
 .
 The Debian package of Nethack includes spoiler files, to be read only
 in sheer desperation, in /usr/doc/nethack/spoilers.
 .
 A few utilities -- recover, for retrieving your auto-save files in case
 of a power failure, and dgn_comp and lev_comp, two utilities for making
 your own Nethack levels and dungeons, have been included in
 /usr/lib/games/nethack. 'recover' will be run every time your system
 boots, if there are any auto-save files available.

 Two players can play against each other. If you fill two or three
 lines with one piece, your opponent gets respectively one or two
 unfilled lines at the bottom of his screen. If you fill four lines
 with one piece, your opponent will get four unfilled lines.
 .

Description: NMAP -- The Network Mapper
 nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine
 for single hosts.  The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap was
 TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It).  This is the Perl slogan, but
 it is equally applicable to scanners.  Sometimes you need speed, other times
 you may need stealth.  In some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required.
 Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different protocols (UDP,
 TCP, ICMP, etc.).  You just can't do all this with one scanning mode.  And
 you don't want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different
 interfaces.  Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know
 into nmap.  Specifically, nmap supports:
 .
        Vanilla TCP connect() scanning,
        TCP SYN (half open) scanning,
        TCP FIN (stealth) scanning,
        TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning
        SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters),
        UDP recvfrom() scanning,
        UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning,
        ICMP scanning (ping-sweep), and
        Reverse-ident scanning.
 .
 nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as
 dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel
 port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings, and flexible
 target and port specification.

 nn stands for "No News is good news", and the nn newsreader is designed to let

 realistically, to allow you to follow even more newsgroups :-).
 .
 nn allows you to quickly select articles of interest and skip the rest.  It
 also supports efficient article killing and selection of articles by author
 and subject.
 .
 This version of nn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network News
 Transfer Protocol), and can make use of your NNTP server's NOV database, if
 configured.  You must have a news server available - large sites usually
 provide a site-wide server.  (For those familiar with 'nn', this is a
 client-only version.)
 .
 (Having recently used both nn and trn, I think it's a tossup as to which is
 best, as trn seems to include many of nn's best features.  If you're a
 diehard nn user, "trn -x -XX" will start trn in a mode which somewhat
 resembles nn.)

Description: a Relational Database Management System for Unix.
 NoSQL is a fast, portable, relational database management system without
 arbitrary limits, (other than memory and processor speed) that runs under,
 and interacts with, the UNIX Operating System.
 .
 It uses the Operator/Stream DBMS paradigm described in "Unix Review",
 March, 1991, page 24, entitled "A 4GL Language".  There are a number of
 "operators" that each perform a unique function on the data.  The "stream"
 is suplied by the UNIX Input/Output redirection mechanism.  Therefore each
 operator processes some data and then passes it along to the next operator
 via the UNIX pipe function.  This is very efficient as UNIX pipes are
 implemented in memory.  NoSQL is compliant with the "Relational Model".
 Read the document "4gl.ps", included with the distribution, for further
 details.

Description: Online Mirror Daemon
 Duplicates directory hierarchies between several machines.
 The omirr package consists of the online mirror daemon in.omirrd and a
 kernel patch.  The daemon supports mirroring of directory hierarchies
 between several machines.  It distributes files, file contents and
 file attributes to remote machines, comparable to the rdist(1)
 program, but it has several differences compared to rdist.
 .
 Firstly, it synchronizes the files online, usually immediately, using
 an interface to the local kernel which notifies the daemon about all
 file system modifications. This results in equivalent file system
 contents of the mirrored hierarchies on all machines. The daemon is
 started once, usually at boot time and then runs continuously. In
 contrast, the rdist program is started manually or from cron, then
 distributes its files and terminates.
 .
 Secondly, it allows symmetric mirroring. With rdist, one file system
 hierarchy is the master version used to update the others. The
 hierarchies synchronized by in.omirrd are all treated equally,
 i.e. there is no master copy. The file system modifications are
 time-stamped and in.omirrd uses the latest version of each file. This
 is the same as concurrently modifying the same file from two Unix
 processes: the last modification takes effect. But, since in.omirrd
 does not support file (or even record) locking, it should not be used
 for file system hierarchies with a lot of concurrent updates on
 several machines or for files usually accessed using locking
 mechanisms, like database files.
 .
 Thirdly, it can synchronize several remote machines concurrently.
 rdist updates multiple hosts sequentially.

 CORBA 2.0 compliant ORB.
 .
 This is a development package which contains an Interface
 Definition Language (IDL) to C++ (pre)compiler as well as
 the ORB library. This environment will allow you to develop
 distributed objects which can communicate with other objects
 without any regard to their location, platform, or language.
 Therefore, it probably makes sense to also install a C++
 development environment for this package to be useful.
 .

 otp  creates  key  and password lists for verification and

 random (most secure) or obey the digraph statistics of En-
 glish text (easier to remember when transcribing, but less
 secure).
 .
 For  computer  applications,  for  example  one-time login
 passwords, otp can create a file containing the MD5 signa-
 ture of each of the generated keys.  This permits the com-
 puter to verify keys without the need to store the keys in
 plaintext.

Description: PCMCIA Card Services for Linux.
 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded
 capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc.  Some desktop PCs
 can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare.
 .
 Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
 includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card
 manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events,
 loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping''
 of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in
 the pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package, where <kernel version> is
 the version of the kernel for which the modules have been compiled.

 implement arrays as simple blocks of a simple data type.  It does
 surprisingly well at many numerical tasks, but, for more demanding tasks, it
 is not sufficient.  Pdl provides data types and methods for multidimensional
 arrays.  New C code has been written, and interfaces to existing C and FORTRAN
 libraries have been added.  A few  large plotting packges have been interfaced.
 Of course, the large collection of perl modules for networking, graphics, and

 It does dependency checks, if you wish. It knows the difference
 between installed, new (and available) packages, and the relationship
 fields (pre-depends, depends, recommends, and suggests). (For
 example, the current packages list need not be read in unless you
 want dependency checks; you may already have done that and now merely
 wish an ordering). It comes with a Test::Harness test suite, to
 protect the world against my typos. Oh, it knows about epochs as well
 if your dpkg does. This could be the basis of mass compiling the
 packages on a new architecture, or to build a release from scratch.
 .
 It creates associative arrays of currently installed packages
 (/var/lib/dpkg/status), and new packages (given a packages file at
 the command line). Then, in the checking dependency phase, for each
 package in the new packages list, it looks at the dependencies, and
 ensure that each dependency is satisfied in either the new list or
 the installed list. If the directive is satisfied from the list of
 new packages, that package is added to the list of packages to be
 topographically sorted. It understands Pre-Depends and will insert
 breaks into the sorted list to separate the installation process into
 separate runs as required to satisfy Pre-Dependencies.
 .
 All this is a set of perl5 libraries, so people may use the API in
 their own scripts.

Description: Keeps a ppp connection alive
 PPPupd, is a simple daemon which maintains a dialup PPP connection.
 PPPupd is able to:
        + Execute a redial script, should the connection drop.
 .
        + Send out periodic pings to keep a connection up, which might
        be disconnected by unruly ISP's who kick their well paying
        members off, after a predetermined number of minutes of
        inactivity.
 .
        + Send logs to stdout, a log file, or syslog, or all three.
 .
 PPPupd's real strength lies in the ability to configure it easily.
 Upon startup, pppupd will read the contents of a configuration file
 (pppupd.cf by default) and execute scripts, ping, or whatever accordingly.
 .
 Note:  ppp itself has some of the same features so you may want to look
 into that first before installing another daemon.  However if ppp's
 persistant features don't work for you (they don't for me) pppupd might
 be useful.

 for situations where you have a URL on one display, and want to access
 it with a browser running on another display.  You can select the URL,
 click "propagate", move over to the other display, and then paste into
 the browser.

Description: An Emacs major mode for editing SGML documents.
 PSGML is a major mode for editing SGML documents.  It contains a
 simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. (The most popular
 nowadays are the HTML DTD's. This package turns your emacs into the
 one of most powerful HTML editors and will be ultimately flexible as
 well, since you could upgrade your editor by just installing new
 DTD's). Functions provided includes menus and commands for inserting
 tags with only the contextually valid tags, identification of
 structural errors, editing of attribute values in a separate window
 with information about types and defaults, and structure based
 editing.
 .
 Since psgml parses the DTD to allow you to edit SGML documents, you do
 need to have the DTD's installed in order to use psgml. Since psgml
 installs itself as an HTML mode in Emacs, it depends on sgml-data. Some
 other packages which also provide SGML DTD's are suggested, like
 debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-sgml.
 .
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO
 standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office
 systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)".
 .
 This is a standard package for XEmacs.

Description: Tools for PostScript printers and devices
 The psptools suite comprise tools for manipulating PostScript (PS) files
 before sending them to a PostScript device. The available tools do use
 PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files to handle the features that
 are available on a given device (for example selecting a color model or
 the way two-sided pages are bound).
 .
 The actual tools are psplpr, a printing/filtering tool that manipulates
 a PostScript document to control which features of a PS device will be
 used to print the document, and npslpr, a small command-line compatible
 replacement for pslpr which uses psplpr.

Description: Improves integration between Python and C++ classes
 A lightweight mechanism, named "ExtensionClass",
 http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/ExtensionClass-1.0.2.tar.gz,
 has been developed for making Python
 extension types more class-like.  Classes can be developed in an
 extension language, such as C or C++, and these classes can be
 treated like other python classes:
 .
  - They can be sub-classed in python,
  - They provide access to method documentation strings, and
  - They can be used to directly create new instances.
 .
 An example class shows how extension classes are implemented and how
 they differ from extension types.
 .
 Extension classes provide additional extensions to class and
 instance semantics, including:
 .
  - A protocol for accessing subobjects "in the context of" their
    containers.  This is used to implement custom method types
    and environmental acquisition.
  - A protocol for overriding method call semantics.  This is used
    to implement "synchronized" classes and could be used to
    implement argument type checking.
  - A protocol for class initialization that supports execution of a
    special '__class_init__' method after a class has been
    initialized.
 .
 Extension classes illustrate how the Python class mechanism can be
 extended and may provide a basis for improved or specialized class
 models.

 (Simple Asynchronous File Transfer) now offers you a true
 asynchronous file transfer service for the Internet.  Virtually any
 form of file can be sent, including encrypted ones.  The SAFT

Description: Control the behaviour of your cdrom device
 This program allows you to control the behaviour of your Linux cdrom
 player.  You'll need a cdrom device that complies to the new interface
 defined in linux/Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex.  For
 kernel 2.0 this is only the cm206 drive, for kernel 2.1 this
 includes IDE and SCSI drives.
 .
 You can control: auto close, auto eject, medium type checking and
 tray locking.  You can get information on the volume name of cdroms
 and other data, and you can set the speed of your drive and choose a
 disc from a jukebox.
 .
 In order to fully exploit the possibilities, you'll need libc6 and a
 recent version of the the linux kernel, but you will get decent error
 behaviour in return.  Expect a message "No medium found" if you
 attempt to mount an empty drive or "Wrong medium type" if you try to
 mount an audio disc, instead of a whole load of kernel error
 messages.
 .
 The source of this package may be an example for cdrom player program
 developers that wish to exploit the features of the new cdrom
 interface.

  *   A high-level keyprocessing interface (SLkp) for
       handling function and arrow keys.
  *   High level screen management routines for manipulating both
       monochrome and color terminals. These routines are very
       efficient. (SLsmg)
  *   Low level terminal-independent routines for manipulating the display
       of a terminal. (SLtt)
  *   Routines for reading single line input with line editing and recall
       capabilities. (SLrline)
  *   Searching functions: both ordinary searches and regular expression
       searches. (SLsearch)
  *   An embedded stack-based language interpreter with a C-like syntax.
 .
 This is the "altdev" version of the S-Lang development package, for building

 SmallEiffel is a compiler for the Eiffel language, which is a pure

 the concept of 'design by contract'.  It allows multiple inheritance
 and does it well.
 .
 Design-by-contract means that a class guarantees that certain conditions
 will always hold, and that a routine guarantees certain results
 given certain specified inputs.  The rules for inheritance mean
 that contracts can be relied on even when classes are reused through
 inheritance.
 .
 The Eiffel language is described and defined in the book "Eiffel: The
 Language" by Bertrand Meyer.

 address). * No hardwired format for (un)subscribe requests (i.e. new
 subscribers need not be educated, unsubscribing users do not need to
 remember any particular syntax). *Intelligent* autoremoval of addresses
 from the list that cause too many bounces. * Duplicate submissions are
 eliminated automatically. * You can set up a mailinglist to function as
 a standalone mail archive server.

Description: Simple spam-block with refusal message
 Using vix.com's Realtime Blackhole List (RBL) can can cause legitimate
 mail to be blocked or bounced. To protect our users, we must bounce it
 with a meaningful message including the reason it was bounced and a
 local phone number.  Because spam often has a bad envelope-from, (and
 because this is more efficient), we must bounce it with an error message
 during the SMTP transaction, rather than send bounce mail later, if the
 bounce is to have much chance of getting back to the sender.
 .
 This SMTP refuser is used along with "tcpd" or another TCP security
 daemon to bounce messages from the IP addresses of known spammers. The
 advantage of this over just blocking the connection is that the remote
 SMTP server will not retry, and a legitimate e-mail sender will get a
 polite message telling them why their mail was blocked and who to call
 to get around the blocking.

Description: Software Upgrade Protocol implementation
 The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon
 University that provide for collections of files to be maintained in
 identical versions across a number of machines.  These programs are:
 .
 SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which
 initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the
 latest  version of a collection of files.  SUP will normally be
 run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to
 upgrade the specified file collections.
 .
 SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the
 system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client
 SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a
 "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously
 and listens for network connection requests by individual client
 processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to
 service that request.
 .
 SUPSCAN: The "file scanner" program, that may optionally be run
 periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It
 pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the
 specifications for a given file collection so that the file server
 need not do this during each upgrade of that collection.  The file
 scanner is normally used daily for very large file collections that
 are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small
 file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client
 machines per day.

Description: Run higher resolution text modes.
 This program is designed to greatly improve the normal
 (EGA-based) textmodes on your Linux machine. It uses an Xconfig-like
 configuration file to set up better looking textmodes. (=higher resolution,
 larger font size, higher display refresh...) This is already a big boon on
 normal 14" displays, and it is an immense difference on larger and better
 (15" and up) screens.
 .
 It stems from the idea that it is a real waste of hardware to use EGA
 textmodes on an SVGA-card, which was designed to do much better than that.
 .
 You will need the `kbd' package if you use screen sizes with a
 character height different from the default.
 .
 WARNING: This program will not work on non-VGA based systems.  Installing it
 will not do any harm, but activating the program can.

 object oriented XPCE environment).  SWI-Prolog has a rich set of
 built-in predicates and reasonable performance, which makes it possible
 to develop substantial applications in it.  The current version offers
 a module system, garbage collection and an interface to the C language.

MD5sum: 62454ace9ce29dcc12dec24aced91ba8
Description: Compatibility package for old termcap-based programs.
 The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap
 files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based
 programs. Since libc6-based programs are hopefully "modern" enough to be
 linked with ncurses (or slang), this package only provides a libc5-based
 libtermcap library.
 .
 You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs
 since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this
 package if a program (that you cannot recompile) fails to run with
 the error message "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'" or complains
 about a missing /etc/termcap file.
 .
 The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs
 therefore it doesn't provide all the necesary files for compilation. If you
 want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try
 ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses
 instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in
 the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries
 to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.
 .
 This package provides:
  libtermcap.so shared library, version 2.0.8
  termcap database, version 9.13.25

 .
 Note that VM now supports viewing MIME messages by itself, and tm-vm
 cannot be used with newer versions of VM; for this reason it is not
 included any more in the Debian package.
 .
 MIME message viewer and composer also support following features:
  * filename handling by Content-Disposition field (RFC 1806)
  * PGP/MIME security Multiparts (RFC 2015)
  * application/pgp Content-Type (draft-kazu-pgp-mime-00.txt)

Description: Cleans up files in directories based on their age
 This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
 directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
 across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
 user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect
 from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the
 process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
 `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
 files unless given a command line option enabling it to.
 .
 WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections
 against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
 functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.

Description: Small yet powerful program for tape oriented backups.
 tob is a simple yet configurable shell-script which, given a set of
 `volume definitions', runs tar or afio based backups, either for use
 with tape drives or floppy disks. You could also mount and unmount
 partitions for backups in the pre- and postcommands. tob is a general
 driver for the making and maintaining of backups.  It makes full
 backups, differential backups (of the files which were changed since
 the last full backup), incremental backups (of files changed since all
 previous backups), lets you determine the size of the backup before
 actually making it, maintain listings of made backups, make remote
 backups and possibly more.

Description: V - a C++ GUI Framework.
 V is a portable C++ GUI framework that supports X, Windows 3.1 and Win32
 (suitable for NT and Windows 95).
 .
 It is implemented on top of a widget set such as Athena but the support for
 Motif has also been incorporated.  For this reason, it has the look and feel
 of the native platform or widget set.  This version is based on the Athena
 widget set.  It is also compatible with at least the Athena 3D widget set,
 and possibly other Athena replacement widget sets.

 VM (View Mail) is an Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read
 and disposed of within Emacs.  Commands exist to do the normal things
 expected of a mail user agent, such as generating replies, saving
 messages to folders, deleting messages and so on.  There are other
 more advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating
 digests, message forwarding, and organizing message presentation
 according to various criteria.
 .
 It should also be mentioned here that the documentation for vm is woefully
 behind the times; there fore we include /usr/doc/vm/vm-vars.el.gz, which
 has information about all customizable variables in vm. Also, VM 6.x
 versions have problems with the library tm-vm from the Tiny Mime (TM)
 package, since that version was written for VM 5.X.

Description: Small, unconfigurable window manager
 wm2 is a window manager for X.  It provides an unusual style of window
 decoration and as little functionality as Chris Cannam feels comfortable
 with in a window manager.  wm2 is not configurable, except by editing
 the source and recompiling the code, and is really intended for people
 who don't particularly want their window manager to be too friendly.
 .
 If you install 9menu and menu, you'll be able to get
 "debian menus" using the wm2-menu command (sorry, Chris).

Description: Yet another window manager. This the next step after AfterStep.
 Written by Alfredo Kojima (http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~kojima) almost from
 scratch, it's better looking and faster than AfterStep, and resembles
 OpenStep more closely. It's also easier to configure than most other window
 managers, and the final goal is to produce a window manager that doesn't
 require editing of configuration files. WindowMaker is fast and
 doesn't require tons of memory to run.
 .
 It's not quite finished yet, but it's notheless usable. It lacks a
 pager, but on the other hand it sports an integrated "Fiend"
 clone. WindowMaker doesn't work with "virtual desktops" but instead of
 that, it has "WorkSpaces".
 .
 It's suggested that you install Joost Witteveen's menu package, as it
 enhances the usefulness and usability of WindowMaker on a Debian
 system greatly. menu will automatically update the desktop menu every
 time an application is added or removed from the system. It can also
 be used to manage the styles menu, backgrounds, and stuff like that.

Description: WindowMaker compiled with superfluous options
 This provides a ghost Dock, ghost icons and a Kaboom effect when
 an icon is removed from the Dock, along with some fine tuning of delays
 in the animations. The WindowMaker author thinks all this is "useless
 stuff that bloats and slows down WindowMaker", but many users really
 like the extra details. On most computers, the extra code doesn't
 make much of a difference in terms of speed. It does requiere just a
 bit more memory.

 WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
 sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
 particular core language. For maximum power WML additionally ships
 with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level
 features build on top of the backends core languages. While not
 trivial and idiot proof WML provides most of the core features real

Description: Secure and efficient http server with advanced features.
 WN is a server for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Its
 primary design goals are security and functionality usually
 available only with complex CGI scripts without the necessity of
 writing or using these scripts.  This includes extensive
 security checks, full text searching and conditionally served
 text.
 .
 Despite this extensive functionality the WN executable is
 substantially smaller than the CERN or NCSA servers.  Both a
 stand-alone daemon and a version intended for use under inetd
 are provided.  The inetd version is designed to minimize the use
 of system resources and it is appropriate for moderate or
 lightly loaded servers which cannot be totally dedicated to Web
 serving.
 .
 WN's security model is based on the use of a small flat database
 in each directory with information about the files in that
 directory.  Fields associated with a file include its title, and
 may include keywords, expiration date and any user defined
 fields like author or document id.  Unlike other servers, the
 default action for WN is to deny access to a file.  A file can
 only be served if explicit permission to do so has been granted
 by entering it in this database.

 timesheet.  I sometimes spend 5 minutes here and there doing
 miscellaneous administrative tasks.  Rather than invoke an editor on a
 timesheet file for every little segment of my time spent doing these
 tasks, I wanted to leave a clock running and indicate with one or two
 keystrokes the onset or change of any given task.  Worklog is a simple
 ncurses based program to do just that.

Description: Operate X-10 electrical power control modules.
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .
 You can buy the modules and manual controllers in Radio Shack stores,
 but the CP-290 serial-interface controller used to command them using your
 Debian system is slightly harder to find. Instructions on where to order
 one are included in the documentation of this package.

Description: Link two X displays together, simulating a multiheaded display
 x2x joins a pair of X displays together, as if they were a single
 multiheaded display.  The pointer can be warped between displays,
 or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the
 other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also
 moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection
 propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically,
 the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension.
 (The servers shipped by Debian support this.)
 .
 x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use
 a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate
 your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might
 be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the
 displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases,
 and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only
 two at a time.

 executed concurrently -- the players do not take "turns", but rather they
 all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of
 players, with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker
 colors.  The game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can
 be occupied by colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate
 the enemy from the board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A
 wide variety of command line options (and previously configured game files)
 provide an abundance of different scenarios and gaming environments.

Description: Monitor mailboxes and/or newsgroups
 Xbuffy is a program that displays how many unread mails you have in
 your different mailboxes.  You can have different titles for the
 mailboxes, and define what shall happen when a new mail arrives.  It
 can beep and invoke a shell command, for example.
 .
 If you press mouse button 1 on the title associated with a mail box,
 a list of From: and Subject: lines of the mails in the mail spool file
 is shown.  If you press mouse button 2, an arbitrary command is
 executed.
 .
 Xbuffy can similarly watch newsgroups via NNTP.

Description: Chinese input server and vt100 terminal for X.
 This package contains XCIN and Crxvt, a Chinese input server
 and a vt100 terminal (Chinese Rxvt) for the X Windows System.
 They both use the Big5 character set, which is the de facto standard
 for places that use traditional Chinese characters, Fantizi.
 .
 Currently, the Debian xcin package defaults to use the 12x24 and
 -dynalab-ming-medium-r-normal-fantizi-24-*-*-*-*-*-big5*-* fonts
 from the xfntbase and xfntbig5p-cmex24m packages.
 .
 If you need the Chinese Postscript HOWTO documents for XCIN,
 please see the xcin-doc package.  (You don't need it unless you
 want to print them.)

Description: Displays an image for each piece of mail in your mailbox.
 XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
 piece of mail in your mail box. This lets you know at a
 glance who you have mail from. XFaces starts out (when you
 have no mail) looking like a color xbiff. As you receive
 mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images. Some of XFaces
 features:
 .
 - Both mono and color images.
 .
 - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.
 .
 - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server
 currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
 SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.
 .
 - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
 show up once on your display. This way, if you receive 30 messages
 from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.
 .
 - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
 images and sounds or ignore that mail message completely. This
 lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
 mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
 left in your system mailbox.
 .
 - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This
 includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
 list.
 .
 - Support for POP mailboxes.
 .
 - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
 contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priority
 item needs your attention.
 .
 - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
 so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
 be used.
 .
 - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
 count, user@host, the contents of any header.

Description: replacement for inetd with many enhancements
 This is a replacement for inetd that offers:
     1) access control on all services based on:
        a) address of remote host
        b) time of access
     Access control works on all services, whether multi-threaded or
     single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP protocols.
     All UDP packets can be checked as well as all TCP connections.
     2) Hard reconfiguration:
        a) kills servers for services that are no longer in the
           configuration file
        b) kills servers that no longer meet the access control criteria
     3) Prevents denial-of-access attacks by
        a) placing limits on the number of servers for each service
           (avoids process table overflows)
        b) placing an upper bound on the number of processes it will fork
        c) placing limits on the size of log files it creates
     5) Extensive logging abilities:
        a) for every server started it can log:
          I) the time when the server was started
          II) the remote host address
          III) who was the remote user (if the other end runs a
              RFC-931/RFC-1413 server)
          IV) how long the server was running
              (I, II and III can be logged for failed attempts too).
        b) for some services, if the access control fails, it can
           log information about the attempted access (for example,
           it can log the user name and command for the rsh service)
     and more..

 non-shared libraries required for X client development. You only need
 to install it if you intend to compile X clients yourself.
 .
 This package only provides statically linked libraries if there is no
 dynamically-linked version available. For statically linked versions of
 the libraries in the xlib6g package, see the xslibg package.

Description: Lock X11 display until password is entered.
 xlock locks the X server till the user enters his/her password at the
 keyboard.  While xlock is running, all new server connections are
 refused. The screen saver is disabled. The mouse cursor is turned off.
 The screen is blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen. If
 a key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted for the
 password of the user who started xlock. xlockmore extends the standard
 xlock program by adding many more modes that are highly configurable.
 .
 Note that under XFree86, the X11 implementation for Linux, Control-
 Alt-Backspace will defeat the locking mechanism and return your
 console back unless you put "DontZap" in your XF86Config file. 'xdm'
 returns to the login prompt. Control-Alt-F1 (among others) will
 defeat locking mechanism with virtual terminals, so make sure that
 you are not logged onto any virtual consoles.
 .
 This version is built without additional OpenGL/MesaGL and XPM modes. The
 companion package xlockmore-gl does contain them.

 .
 By default it is set to do a colour, shaped, but non-animated, icon: this
 is apparently possible with xbiff if you tweak the resources. By tweaking
 the resources of xmailbox you can get animated icons.

Description: Network Time Protocol clients and server
 The Network Time Protocol allows for the synchronization of clocks on
 networked computers.  The xntpd daemon implements NTP, allowing Unix
 systems to participate in this synchronization.
 .
 NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce
 systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of
 synchronizing with even the most precise external time sources.
 .
 The NTP protocol supported by xntpd is defined in RFC's 1059, 1119, and
 1305 for versions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  For more information on how
 NTP works, and how to configure a campus of xntpd daemons, load the optional

Description: A lode-runner-like platform game for X
 XScavenger is a platform game for the X Window System. From the README:
 .
 Scavenger is like Lode Runner. You've got to run around gathering objects
 while avoiding enemies. You can dig down through some of the blocks to get
 at buried objects. After you've collected everything, ladders may appear.
 To finish the level you've got to exit through the top of the screen. If
 an enemy falls into a dug brick, he is stunned for a while. If the brick
 fills in with him in it, he is killed, and he will reappear at the top of
 the screen.
 .
 This version has a level editor for designing your own levels, and a
 graphics editor for drawing your own artwork.

Description: Automatic screensaver for X
 The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen
 when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended
 monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like they do
 in the movies.
 .
 The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock and
 xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
 installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
 mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
 invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
 now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
 are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
 about what it means to be a screensaver.

Description: X server for VGA graphics cards and X server setup program
 This package provides a 16-color X server suitable for use with most
 generic VGA cards.  Support is provided for many popular chipsets from
 ATI, Cirrus, Oak, Trident, and Tseng, but this server does not take
 advantage of any hardware acceleration features that may be present in
 the chipset.  This server may be run in conjunction with another in a
 dual-headed configuration.
 .
 This package also contains the "XF86Setup" program, a graphical tool
 for configuring X servers.  If you want to use this tool to set up your
 X server then you must install this package.  If you do not, or if the
 vga16 server does not support your video card, you will have to use the
 text-based "xf86config" program.

Description: X terminal-emulator similar to xterm, but smaller
 xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less
 compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly
 intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but
 may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory.
 The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use
 of the X toolkit.
 .
 If you are looking for a more featureful terminal-emulator than xvt,
 but one which still uses less swap space than xterm, consider rxvt.
 .
 Features of xterm which xvt does not support include:
 .
  - Tektronix 4014 emulation
  - Session logging
  - Pop-up menus.  The only one of xterm's popup menu commands that
    is provided in xvt is displaying and hiding of the scrollbar
    and this is done simply by pressing any mouse key in the window
    with the CONTROL key held down.
  - Toolkit style configurability.  In particular, xvt does not
    allow the user to remap the mouse or keyboard keys.
 .
 Features which are supported include:
 .
  - VT100 emulation.  Most of the main escape sequences are supported --
    certainly all those used by the standard screen based UNIX
    applications.
  - Lines that scroll off the top of the window are saved and can be
    scrolled back with a scrollbar.
  - Text selection and insertion including double and triple click for
    words and lines.

Description: A small freeware Forth environment in ANSI C.
 From the author's README:
 .
 yForth? is a Forth environment written entirely in ANSI C, making it
 extremely portable. The first thing I want to tell you about yForth? is
 that it seems a joke compared to other systems such as gForth or PFE.
 .
 Nevertheless, you could find yForth? nice, in which case you're invited to
 explore yForth?
 .
 It's yours, you can make anything you want with it. If you want an explanation
 of the words provided by yForth? please refer to the draft of ANS Forth or
 something equivalent.  The Net will help you.
 .
 Do not expect the prompt "ok" to come up when you run yForth?, the standard
 says that "ok" shall be printed AFTER every successful command execution...

Description: CGM graphics file browser only
 You can display binary CGMs to X, and write PostScript or CGM output.
 Gist is tuned to work best with Yorick-generated CGMs.  Since CGM is
 not a page description (PostScript is), non-Yorick CGMs may not display
 exactly as intended.  In general, you should avoid CGMs for this reason.
 .
 If you install the yorick package, you get gist as well; this package
 is only for those who want gist but not yorick.

 Zile should really appear like Emacs, but a lot of ideas were also
 taken from from other editors:
  * Emacs: General look-n-feel, function names, function behaviors,
    key bindings.
  * XEmacs: Some minor hints for look-n-feel.
  * Jed: Mini help window, mode line.
  * ce: Structure names, function names.
