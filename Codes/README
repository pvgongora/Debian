#The program receives a list of virtual packages, a list of provided packages, the package dependencies and 
#the number associated to every package, as well as a last number to identify the distribution.

#After build the Debian network making an election for the possible virtual packages, the algorithm call to R or
#the different external programs to compute the network properties. 
#For example an execution line can be
